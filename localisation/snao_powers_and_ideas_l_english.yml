 picking_up_the_pieces_desc: "中亚地区四分五裂，各方势力都试图统一不同的地方，但从我们的视角来看，这一切都是徒劳的。察合台的力量早已今非昔比，但我们绝不能对这种情况感到自满！无论通过外交手段还是军事力量，察合台的力量必须且必将得到恢复！"
 unification_of_central_asia: "中亚统一"
 unification_of_central_asia_desc: "伟大的蒙古帝国早已不复存在，其最著名的继承者元朝也是如此。帝国解体后留下的是一片混乱，但只要我们再次正确地维护和巩固蒙古人的权威，就没有什么是无法解决的。这将是一段漫长的征程，但中亚将成为我们实现更大野心的基石。"
 modernize_and_adapt: "现代化与适应"
 modernize_and_adapt_desc: "可汗和骑兵的时代正逐渐成为遥远的过去，显而易见，国王、女王、皇帝、皇后以及公爵、公爵夫人的时代已经来临。察合台的领导层需要适应影响我们社会和行政的外部力量，不能一味地坚守过去的传统，而是要尝试改革国家的某些方面，与未来的新技术和新观念相融合。"
 quick_and_vicious_movement: "快速而猛烈的行动"
 quick_and_vicious_movement_desc: "蒙古帝国时期留给我们的传统之一，就是军队快速高效行动的理念，尽管当时的军队大多由骑兵组成。即便如此，如今我们仍能将这些理念应用到现有的军队中，比敌人更快地在各地、城镇和堡垒之间移动。"
# mediate_buddhust_islam_encounters: "调解伊斯兰教与佛教的相遇"
# mediate_buddhust_islam_encounters_desc: "中亚的道路上既没有完全信奉佛教的社区，也没有完全信奉伊斯兰教的社区，不过，在察合台的土地上，这两种宗教的社区经常相互接触。通过帮助这两种宗教以和平的方式进行交流和辩论，我们可以缓解察合台土地上因宗教差异而产生的紧张局势。"
 chagatai_enforcement_of_islam: "有伊斯兰教，就有权威"
 chagatai_enforcement_of_islam_desc: "我们人民生活的草原上，村庄和城镇就像广袤原野上的一个个小点。这意味着不仅政府机构普遍较弱，宗教机构也是如此；而察合台汗国非常依赖宗教机构来帮助控制这片土地。如果我们能在这些土地上更牢固地确立伊斯兰教的地位，建造更多的清真寺并增加宗教学者的数量，我们的权威将随着时间的推移而不断增强。"
 silk_road_trade: "丝绸之路贸易"
 silk_road_trade_desc: "与丝绸之路沿线的人们进行贸易，尽管如今的贸易规模远不及过去，但这仍帮助察合台的人民繁荣起来，并让他们了解到各种观念，包括雇佣军合同。我们为丝绸之路所做的贡献也会以不同的、有时甚至更好的形式回馈给我们，比如更廉价的雇佣军，这并不奇怪。"
 reform_the_mongol_empire: "改革蒙古帝国"
 reform_the_mongol_empire_desc: "有人说，这份遗产无比伟大；也有人说，要完全恢复它是不可能的。啊，但这些人并不了解察合台人民的力量，也没有这样的信心。这将是一个细致且耗时的过程，但通过无数人的鲜血，经历和平与战争的洗礼，察合台民族将重新夺回蒙古帝国的荣耀！"

 the_manghits: "曼吉特人"
 the_manghits_desc: "曼吉特人是一个蒙古部落，构成了我们民族的核心基础。我们较为知名的领袖之一埃季古，他的父亲来自曼吉特部落，母亲来自术赤部落，这使他在诺盖人民眼中更具合法性。因此，曼吉特人不仅鼓舞人心，还在该地区和诺盖部落中确立了自己的地位。"
 centralize_the_lesser_greater_nogay: "统一诺盖人民"
 centralize_the_lesser_greater_nogay_desc: "我们几乎可以预见未来的问题，因为我们分散的人口无疑会在以后引发行政问题。诺盖各地与诺盖汗国中央权威几乎没有联系的人民将孤立无援，任由任何前来夺取权力的人摆布。我们绝不能让这种情况发生；我们的土地上必须有畅通的沟通渠道，这样我们才能轻松地将信息传递到王国的最偏远地区。"
 weak_religious_institutions: "薄弱的宗教机构"
 weak_religious_institutions_desc: "虽然从根本上说我们以伊斯兰教为基础，但我们的土地上几乎没有清真寺或其他正式的礼拜场所。因此，如果有人穿越诺盖领土，他们可能甚至意识不到这里的人民和行政机构信奉伊斯兰教，这无意中使我们对异教徒和非信徒更加宽容。"
 khanate_rivalries: "汗国的竞争对手"
 khanate_rivalries_desc: "在广袤的欧亚草原上，有几个小可汗凭借他们控制的少量军事力量宣称拥有权威。然而，诺盖汗国可以积极挑战这些权威宣称，并为我们居住的草原上的合法性而战。在我们的家园，可能只有一个拥有绝对权威的人，其他所有人要么是竞争对手，要么将成为臣民！"
 keep_nomadic_traditions: "保持我们的游牧传统"
 keep_nomadic_traditions_desc: "我们的游牧起源并不容易改变或摒弃；袭击和掠夺敌对土地并将战利品带回部落的行为是我们继承下来的，我们不能也不会轻易放弃。"
 fluid_political_organization: "灵活的政治组织"
 fluid_political_organization_desc: "由于我们人口分散、领土广阔，诺盖汗国的政治更像是几乎不受阻碍的流水，而我们周围的王国和帝国在中央政府和众多顾问方面遇到了无数问题。无论如何，我们的政治运作方式将有助于保持人民的忠诚和满足。"

 memory_of_temujin: "铁木真的记忆"
 memory_of_temujin_desc: "铁木真·成吉思汗曾让世界在他和他的骑兵面前颤抖，但在他走出蒙古地区之前，他首先必须应对各个蒙古部落，比如现在构成卫拉特联盟的那些部落。我们仍然将13世纪的征服记忆视为值得重温的历史，以及其留下的遗产，值得我们再次去驾驭……除了卫拉特人，还有谁能让这些记忆再次成为现实呢？"
 ming_rivalry: "与明朝的竞争"
 ming_rivalry_desc: "我们与南方的冒牌货，即所谓的‘明朝’之间的竞争，无时无刻不处于战争边缘。他们亵渎并击退了我们的蒙古同胞，现在还宣称进入了一个复兴强盛的时代，但他们不知道，异议者在中国各地广泛存在！我们将把这些异议者和反叛者纳入我们的队伍，并亲自训练他们，这样在战争来临时，我们就能让他们与明朝作战。"
 fall_of_the_yuan: "元朝的覆灭"
 fall_of_the_yuan_desc: "由忽必烈汗于1272年建立，至1370年被红巾军叛乱驱逐，元朝或许是铁木真建立的蒙古帝国最伟大的继承者。瓦剌部落是唯一仍可能拥有足够力量夺回元朝曾经领土的认真竞争者。若上天眷顾我们此次事业，我们将宣布自己为元朝的真正继承者，并永远封印明朝之流。"
 past_the_great_wall: "越过长城"
 past_the_great_wall_desc: "洪武帝和永乐帝于14世纪末/15世纪初致力于重建和改进长城，以遏制我们的威胁，但我们若非善于寻找绕过这些防御的方法（或许反而是通过这些防御），又算得了什么。我们将创新并调整战术，确保北方的这些防御工事无法阻止我们的骑兵洪流席卷南下，进入中国的核心地带。"
 religious_indifference: "宗教漠视"
 religious_indifference_desc: "若要谈及瓦剌部落的宗教，可以说它相当开放且免于迫害。我们有自己的信仰，但并不期望他人皈依并从头学习我们的传统，那只会引发不安和不信任。相反，适度的宗教漠视是保持我们人民团结的关键。"
 unification_of_the_mongols: "蒙古的统一"
 unification_of_the_mongols_desc: "蒙古人不满足于被外国势力分割并被推回草原。瓦剌部落保留着将分散的蒙古部落统一成一个伟大帝国的雄心，这个帝国将让世界臣服，而实现这一目标的将是瓦剌部落。"

 reign_over_many_tribes: "统治多个部落"
 reign_over_many_tribes_desc: "我们宣称属于乌兹别克领地的广袤草原上，遍布着不同的部落，他们的忠诚度往好了说也时常令人怀疑。不过，这些部落与不同统治者和可汗所在的地区有联系；通过这些部落关系，我们可以从基层逐步提升自己的名声和威望。"
 degrading_golden_horde_influence: "金帐汗国的衰落"
 degrading_golden_horde_influence_desc: "来自西方的权威已今非昔比。莫斯科和诺夫哥罗德的斯拉夫人正积极试图接管曾经属于金帐汗国的土地，就像我们在东方所做的一样。这种权威的减弱也让我们有了更多按自己意愿治理领地的自由；我们不再需要向远在西方、常常有更紧迫事务缠身的统治者纳贡或效命。"
 contest_over_southern_lands: "南方冲突"
 contest_over_southern_lands_desc: "河中地区的土地一直理所当然地是更大的昔班尼领地的一部分，但帖木儿及其追随者对这一主张提出异议，并试图将其夺走。如果我们要坚持自己作为昔班尼领地合法继承人的主张，那么南方的这些冲突最终必须以乌兹别克的胜利告终。"
 settle_issues_with_tribes: "解决内部问题"
 settle_issues_with_tribes_desc: "昔班尼领地内的众多部落并不总是和平相处，部落之间，或者部落与统治机构之间的争端，常常会引发血腥仇杀，可能会使我国的大片地区陷入不稳定。现在是时候设立正式的场所（也许是建筑物），让各部落的代表或首领们在此会面，讨论并调解彼此之间的问题了。这样做肯定会减少流血冲突，至少比以前的情况要好得多。"
 consolidate_shaybanid_domain: "巩固昔班尼领地"
 consolidate_shaybanid_domain_desc: "我们统治的广袤土地上，城镇和村庄星罗棋布。它们可能分布得较为分散，但我们可以将它们作为乌兹别克人正式定居点的起点，我们可以对这些定居点合理征税，也可以从中征召士兵。这是一个实行中央集权而非地方分权的问题。"
 abulkharids: "阿布勒哈里德家族"
 abulkharids_desc: "阿布勒哈里德家族是更庞大的昔班尼王朝的一个独特分支，其最著名的统治者之一阿布勒·海尔汗，帮助巩固了乌兹别克人在整个昔班尼领地的统治地位。正是通过阿布勒哈里德家族，我们找到了团结和力量的坚实基础，也正是依靠他们，我们至少一部分人民得以凝聚在一起。"
 ascend_from_nomadic_life: "告别游牧生活"
 ascend_from_nomadic_life_desc: "草原游牧民族的生活方式已今非昔比。越来越多的机构和国家宣扬这些机构的理念，逐渐侵蚀着我们祖先生活方式的根基。也许现在是乌兹别克人民定居下来，以农耕民族而非游牧民族的身份开启新生活的时候了。"
 JIN_ideas: "晋朝理念"

 winners_of_the_three_kingdoms: "三国时期的胜利者"
 winners_of_the_three_kingdoms_desc: "在2世纪中叶，司马氏家族在占主导地位的魏国行政体系中逐步崛起，并于266年通过司马炎实际夺取了魏国王位。此后，晋朝成为中国事务中的主导力量，最后一个抵抗堡垒——东吴，于280年被征服。即便战争失利，凭借这份遗产，我们仍能再次崛起，重获显赫地位和声望。"
 lodged_administrative_divisions: "侨置行政区划"
 lodged_administrative_divisions_desc: "晋朝的一个关键特征是东晋发展出的侨置行政区划。这些行政区划不仅有助于治理中国南方一些难以到达的地区，还以一种有助于缓解来自不同内部源头压力的方式，构建了晋朝的政府架构。恢复这些行政区划对我们有益，这样我们也能从更完善的政府治理形式中获益。"
 battle_against_former_qin: "与前秦的战争"
 battle_against_former_qin_desc: "从约351年到394年，前秦一直是东晋的主要对手，直到淝水之战（383年）。晋朝的这场胜利不仅有助于确立其统治的合法性，还确保了中国其他地区免受伪政权的侵害。我们应该铭记这场战役和这次胜利，因为这或许是我们历史上最伟大的时刻之一。"
 manipulation_of_taoism: "利用道教"
 manipulation_of_taoism_desc: "道教在中国周边更多的乡村社区中较为常见，而儒家思想则在中国的行政体系中占据主导地位。就像我们的祖先一样，我们应该密切关注道教以及它如何管理这些乡村社会，因为如果我们能通过道教影响民众（反之亦然），我们就能确保边疆地区的稳定和安全。"
 war_of_the_eight_princes: "八王之乱"
 war_of_the_eight_princes_desc: "从291年到306年的这段内乱时期，即我们所知的‘八王之乱’，是由于对晋惠帝（他有发育障碍）的摄政之争而爆发的。尽管这一时期并非持续战乱，确实也有和平时期，但它给晋朝的核心地区造成了巨大破坏。我们必须确保不再发生这样的皇位继承争斗，并在未来的继承纠纷波及到皇位之前进行调解。"
 the_five_barbarians: "五胡乱华"
 the_five_barbarians_desc: "那些入侵并推翻西晋的人，曾经玷污了我们，但我们绝不会再让这种事情发生。部分由五胡入侵引发的混乱导致了东晋的建立，也使得整个晋朝的势力随后衰落，然而，我们从这次危机中恢复过来，并将胡人赶回了北方。我们必须铭记这段历史教训，绝不让那些胡人再次进入中国。"
 zhongguo: "中国，中央之国"
 zhongguo_desc: "对许多人来说，统一的中央之国不过是一个梦想。多个王朝兴起又衰落，皆因各种原因销声匿迹。我们会成为又一个兴衰更迭的王朝吗？不，我们绝不能如此消极地看待。迈向统一与辉煌的征程已然开启；我们将见证分裂时代的终结，为中国人民宣告一个新的王朝，但首先，我们必须经受住前方的考验。"

 ancient_shu_state: "古蜀国"
 ancient_shu_state_desc: "很久以前，四川盆地的人民建立了一个独立王国，并一直保持独立，直到被秦国（秦朝的前身）吞并。我们的人民没有忘记自己的悠久历史，也没有忘记这段历史与四川盆地以外地区的不同，中国其他地区的人们同样没有忘记。"
 shu_han: "蜀汉"
 shu_han_desc: "三国时期的刘备宣称蜀是汉朝的合法继承者，这让蜀在当时忠于汉朝的人眼中更具合法性。我们没有忘记这一宣称，尽管汉朝只是中国历史中的一个篇章，但我们仍然认为自己是中国合法的统治者。"
 three_kingdoms_period_shu: "三国时期"
 three_kingdoms_period_shu_desc: "三国时期对四川人民和整个蜀国的历史至关重要。221年，刘备建立了独立的蜀国。正是在这个时期，蜀在历史上留下了不朽的印记，也是我们如今汲取灵感、追求统一和借鉴经验的源泉。"
 zhuge_liang: "诸葛亮"
 zhuge_liang_desc: "223年刘备去世后，他的继承人刘禅16岁即位，由诸葛亮和李严担任摄政，负责大部分政务。诸葛亮尤其掌控了大部分事务，并试图通过228年至234年的多次北伐，让蜀国在对抗强大的魏国时占据更有利的地位。尽管这些北伐在政治或军事舞台上都没有带来重大变化，但诸葛亮展现出的坚韧、智谋以及对蜀国的忠诚，是我们所有人都钦佩并努力效仿的。"
 defensive_position: "防御优势"
 defensive_position_desc: "四川盆地的地理环境使其非常适合防御。这在三国时期就显而易见，因为从蜀地发起进攻需要付出更多的努力和资源，而防御则相对容易。我们应该牢记这一点，并在可能的情况下加强我们的防御。"
 connections_through_trade: "贸易联系"
 connections_through_trade_desc: "四川盆地以及蜀国在3世纪早期至中期崛起的一个关键因素是通过贸易建立的联系。四川盆地的南部和西部是一些难以征服但贸易机会丰厚的分裂地区。我们不必总是征服那些能为我们提供财富和资源的地方，因为它们迟早会向蜀地人民臣服。我们应该追求仁爱，而非残暴。"
 zhongguo: "中国，中央之国"
 zhongguo_desc: "对许多人来说，统一的中央之国不过是一个梦想。多个王朝兴起又衰落，皆因各种原因销声匿迹。我们会成为又一个兴衰更迭的王朝吗？不，我们绝不能如此消极地看待。迈向统一与辉煌的征程已然开启；我们将见证分裂时代的终结，为中国人民宣告一个新的王朝，但首先，我们必须经受住前方的考验。"

 promote_coastal_trade: "促进沿海贸易"

 five_dynasties_ten_kingdoms_period_desc: "公元907年钱镠建立的吴越国，或许是唐朝之后这个混乱时期南方最强大的政权。在其独立至978年期间，许多基础设施项目得以启动，吴地得到了极大的发展，为该地区带来了更多的价值。"

 foundation_in_myths: "神话中的起源"
 foundation_in_myths_desc: "根据司马迁《史记》中的传说，楚国的王室是黄帝（又称黄帝）及其孙子/继承者颛顼的后裔。尽管王室诞生的故事远比这复杂，但我们与中国传统神话和神灵的联系，让我们在国内外都享有威望。"
 control_over_central_china: "掌控中原"
 control_over_central_china_desc: "中原地区土地肥沃，农业发展潜力巨大，自然也拥有大量人口。楚国在该地区的根基使其能够通过从更容易开发和管理的地方组建庞大军队来实现扩张。我们必须遵循这种思路，继续在楚国各地建设城市中心，以免在军事或经济潜力上落后。"
 the_spring_autumn_period: "春秋时期"
 the_spring_autumn_period_desc: "公元前700年代后期，东周权威的衰落成为楚国和其他许多国家的集结号。随着洛邑朝廷的权威下降（早在公元前771年犬戎入侵之前就已经开始衰落），小国的权力大幅增长，以至于它们会为了霸权而相互征战，很少关注东周。正是在这个时期，楚国获得了力量和为自己而战的激情，我们至今仍未失去这些。"
 take_on_gov_corruption: "打击政府腐败"
 take_on_gov_corruption_desc: "楚国政府的一个问题是有时腐败现象严重。军队和政府中的官员经常进行秘密交易或收受贿赂，无人能够制止。如果我们要在行政任务和军事组织上取得成功，就需要对腐败采取更严格的立场，并对被认定有腐败关系的人施以更严厉的惩罚。"
 qin_chu_rivalry: "秦楚 rivalry（原词拼写有误，应为Rivalry）"
 qin_chu_rivalry_desc: "我们最激烈、最致命的对手是奉行法家思想的秦国。尽管我们在军事规模和领土面积上都比他们大，但他们更加纪律严明，注重行政管理；我们的祖先根本无法与他们竞争，大约在公元前223年被他们击败。现在我们复兴了，我们应该改革军队，在内部实行适当的纪律，这样任何企图挑战我们权力的对手都不会轻易获胜。法家思想可以稍后再考虑。"
 stop_internal_decadence: "制止内部堕落"
 stop_internal_decadence_desc: "在春秋时期和随后的战国时期，我们文化的一个主要特点就是非常轻松和悠闲，以至于这种文化开始在更大范围内影响社会。当然，我们的艺术和手工艺确实独具特色，文化也蓬勃发展，但这种悠闲的态度会导致社会效率低下，进而走向堕落，我们的祖先无疑就经历了这样的情况。我们的文化中可以有艺术和娱乐，但楚国必须在各个层面都保持高效和强大。"

 treaty_of_paris_1229_desc: "根据该条约，我们所在的奥克西塔尼地区失去了政治自治权，并被并入法国版图。然而，这并非暴力吞并，而是我们通过联姻融入其他国家并从内部获取影响力的一种方式。诚然，该条约让我们付出了沉重的代价，但我们将来一定会确保联姻和王朝联盟朝着对我们有利的方向发展。"
 revenge_for_albigensian_crusade: "为祖先复仇"
 revenge_for_albigensian_crusade_desc: "不久前的阿尔比派十字军东征对我们的人民来说是一场巨大的损失。北方那些可恶的天主教徒和教皇本人呼吁彻底消灭清洁派信仰，导致了我们的衰落，此后我们一直难以恢复。现在是我们自己行动起来的时候了，要让其他人知道我们不会忘记阿尔比派十字军东征。"
 the_cathar_faith: "清洁派信仰"
 the_cathar_faith_desc: "12至14世纪，清洁派在图卢兹和朗格多克地区盛行，但阿尔比派十字军东征给了它沉重而血腥的打击。现在清洁派正在复兴，我们必须推广它，并从其教义中寻求慰藉。"

 successor_to_the_visigoths_desc: "在7至8世纪，阿基坦地区受到罗马和西哥特法律的影响，这些法律相互融合，形成了一种混合的行政管理体系，对我们很有帮助。回顾这种法律组合，不仅对其进行改革，还将其编纂成典，可能对整个国家都有好处。"
 carolingian_legacy: "加洛林王朝遗产"
 carolingian_legacy_desc: "法兰克王国内部复杂的王朝、伯爵和封地体系无疑很难驾驭，但阿基坦的贵族们在查理曼大帝的儿子丕平一世之后，在这个体系中取得了显著的进展，并于814年获得了阿基坦的土地。现在，我们有责任用我们的一切来保卫这片土地，守护祖先的遗产，确保我们自身的安全。"
 eleanor_of_aquitaine: "阿基坦的埃莉诺"
 eleanor_of_aquitaine_desc: "也许我们最著名的人物就是来自普瓦捷家族的埃莉诺，她在父亲去世后继承了阿基坦。12世纪，她在英格兰和法国的政治舞台上纵横捭阖，通过外交和联姻行动精心照料阿基坦。尽管她的去世使我们的土地归属于英格兰国王亨利二世，但她的记忆和功绩将永存。"

 english_and_french_influences_desc: "英格兰和法国都曾试图接管阿基坦并牢牢控制它，但这无疑是一件很难做到的事情。不过，由于我们与两国都有过接触，我们可以借此机会反思并向双方学习。尽管英格兰和法国在土地管理、继承事务和征税等方面可能有不同的方式，但我们仍然可以学习并利用这些经验，不是吗？"
 fertility_of_aquitaine: "阿基坦的肥沃土地"

 assiniboine_political_power: "阿西尼博因人的政治权力"
 assiniboine_political_power_desc: "我们在自己土地上的政治权威广为人知，但在外部却很少得到认可。阿西尼博因人比许多人认为的更强大，我们宣称自己是一个真正的联盟而非仅仅是一个部落，就是这一点的体现；那些与我们作对的人这样做是愚蠢的。我们征服的人将加入我们，在我们公正的统治下享受和平。"

 great_plains_trade_hub_desc: "我们为培育独特而强大的卡多社会所做的努力没有被忽视。许多远方的人来到我们这里寻求贸易机会，我们欣然欢迎他们。我们对贸易的影响力越大越好，因为这样我们就能从贸易中获得更多的收入。"

 non_human_sacrifices: "非人类献祭"
 non_human_sacrifices_desc: "与我们周围的阿兹特克人不同，我们并非一直实行人祭。我们的玉米女神认为这种献祭不值得且没有必要，所以我们改为献上草药、鲜花和动物作为祭品。那些原本可能被用于人祭的人，可以转而在托托纳克社会中工作，开垦未耕种的土地……如果他们违抗命令，太阳神将会取走他们和他们的心脏。"

 tight_administrative_structure_desc: "由于马特拉斯钦卡人在托卢卡山谷的生活方式，行政结构必须紧密且集中。这对外人来说可能很奇怪，但对我们来说，这是自然且必要的。分散的行政体系只会导致所有马特拉斯钦卡城市及其权力的瓦解。"

 malay_peninsula_northern_expansionism_desc: "马来与过去的三佛齐和满者伯夷帝国并无不同，征服确实是必要的。就像海军对征服各个地区至关重要一样，我们也需要海军来扩大自己的边界。贸易是马来的生命线，我们绝不能让竞争对手通过控制重要的贸易中心和港口来夺走这条生命线。因此，为了马来国家的更大利益，我们必须征服、吞并和整合。"

 quell_the_dynastic_fights_desc: "如果说我们国家有一个一直存在且也是导致阿达尔苏丹国覆灭的因素，那就是王朝争端。我们需要找到一种一劳永逸的解决办法，以免重蹈阿达尔苏丹国内乱的覆辙。伊玛目和维齐尔都可能导致这种致命的结局，因此我们也需要处理好与他们的关系。"

 sunni_horde_conquest_desc: "和我们南方的邻国一样（也许伊朗除外），逊尼派国家的征服似乎是自然而然的事情。尽管到处都有虔诚和宗教教义的说法，但实际上草原上很少遵循这些法则，巴什基尔人会欣然利用这一事实，以及逊尼派穆斯林以伊斯兰教之名、为自身利益征服大片土地的传统。"

 become_a_bastion_for_islam_desc: "伊斯兰教起源于我们南方很远的地方，通过征服和自愿皈依传播到了伏尔加河流域，但北方的基督徒不惜一切代价试图让伊斯兰社区改信。由于我们处于伊斯兰教向北传播的前沿，我们应该努力成为信仰的堡垒，将我们的首都建设成为伊斯兰学习和文化的中心。如果我们能长期做到这一点，我们将会看到越来越多虔诚的信徒来到我们的土地，帮助我们完成众多事业。"

 avenues_for_expansion_desc: "当抛开地图上的政治边界，我们所在的这片土地除了河流之外几乎没有天然边界；卡西姆人习惯看到的大多是适合游牧和放牧的平原。因此，从理论上讲，这片土地很容易被征服。但实际操作完全是另一回事，卡西姆的行政管理部门需要采取大量措施来管理这些被征服的土地。凭借我们部分俄罗斯化且灵活的行政管理体系，这应该不会是一项特别艰巨的任务。"

 lands_of_a_buffer_state: "缓冲国之地"

 control_over_inner_tribes: "控制内陆部落"
 control_over_inner_tribes_desc: "的黎波里以其海岸而闻名，而非内陆地区，这是有充分理由的。沿海城市贸易利润丰厚，是海盗的避风港，而内陆沙漠则是难以控制的柏柏尔游牧部落的家园。然而，随着时间的推移，这种情况必须改变，因为我们不能再任由这些部落四处游荡，对的黎波里的贸易和内部联系造成破坏。利用他们并与他们进行外交谈判，以便我们能够逐步将他们融入的黎波里塔尼亚国家，这将有助于确保我们有足够的后备力量。"

 vie_for_naval_supremacy_desc: "在公海上持续争夺主导权让的黎波里的海军积累了丰富的战斗经验，这意味着他们在海战中擅长远程作战和近身搏斗。我们的一些顶级海军将领甚至热衷于俘获敌方船只，以便修复后用于的黎波里塔尼亚的主力舰队，这一策略可能很快就会派上用场。"
 construct_naval_bases: "建造海军基地"
 construct_naval_bases_desc: "进入的黎波里塔尼亚的通道，除了恶劣的沙漠和小型沿海村庄外，主要是贸易汇聚的港口。这些港口常常容易受到敌方船只的炮击或内陆入侵的威胁，无论是哪种情况，都会危及的黎波里本身的生存。解决办法是什么呢？建造海军基地和防御工事，这样我们就可以在修理船只时保护舰队，更快地建造船只，并且以更有组织的方式进行自我防御。"

 jolof_societal_structure_desc: "在 Jolof 及其附属国，存在着严格的社会阶层制度。有各种王室阶层、非王室贵族、自由民、从事各种种姓工作的人，最后是奴隶。除此之外，吟游诗人对于讲述 Jolof 的祖先故事和历史非常重要，因此他们自成一个社会阶层。如果 Jolof 要成为一个稳定的国家，就必须保留这种社会阶层等级制度，只有在我们确定做好准备后才进行改革。"

 fortify_kaabu_frontiers_desc: "最初，坎萨拉以及卡布的核心区域只是马里帝国建立的一个军事前哨站。然而，几十年来，它已经发展成为一个文化和军事力量的中心，必须不惜一切代价进行保卫。自卡布建立以来，我们更多地依赖进攻而非防御，但鉴于坎萨拉在我们的行政和军事事务中变得越来越重要，而且我们的贸易仓库也越来越受到许多不同群体的重视，我们需要用城墙和驻军妥善加固我们目前控制的地区。"

 the_only_oromo_confederation_desc: "从某种意义上说，我们是孤独的。世界上没有其他奥罗莫国家，只有我们。我们的同胞可能分散在附近的地区，但他们不像我们这样独立。作为奥罗莫人民的希望之光，我们必须将他们聚集在我们的旗帜下，向他们展示，只要有足够的坚韧和勇猛，就有可能迎来没有硝烟和鲜血的一天。让他们聚集到我们身边，成为这唯一的奥罗莫联盟的一部分。"
 abba_boku_style_administration: "加达制度"
 abba_boku_style_administration_desc: "我们奥罗莫人采用的传统民主治理方式相对稳定，为我们带来了繁荣和团结。在加达制度下，每八年奥罗莫人民通过共识选出九位领导人，称为‘萨尔甘·亚伊·博拉纳’，即‘九个博拉纳议会’。通过加达制度选出的领导人任期仅为八年，选举在任期结束时举行。如果阿巴·加达在任期内去世，‘博库’（权力象征）将传给他的妻子，直到任期结束。"

 settle_the_oromo_feuds_desc: "奥罗莫人的迁徙对许多民族，包括奥罗莫人自己，都产生了不利影响。曾经被搁置的争端再次爆发，新的纠纷也在我们迁徙到现在的居住地的过程中产生。我们必须不断努力解决这些争端，否则迟早会被它们撕裂。"

 the_position_of_azazi_desc: "阿扎齐（意为‘秩序维护者’）在未来对我们将很有用，将作为行政领导人之一。他的职责仅负责国内事务，管理我们所有的国库，并管理与吉马中央宫廷相关的财务。这样一个声望高且重要的职位将吸引许多优秀的人来到我们的宫廷，因此我们要确保对他们进行严格审查，并且他们都有奥罗莫血统。"
 more_professional_oromo_soldiers: "更专业的奥罗莫士兵"
 more_professional_oromo_soldiers_desc: "我们民族的士兵来自各行各业，实际上很多人在被征召入伍时，我们并没有为他们提供合适的武器或训练，但我们正在从对保卫中央宫廷和宫殿的私人卫队的管理中学习如何做得更好。如果我们能将他们的训练和纪律推广到普通的奥罗莫士兵身上，我们在与邻国的战争中就会有更大的胜算。"
 multi_functional_slaves: "多功能奴隶"
 multi_functional_slaves_desc: "吉马的奴隶不像典型的奴隶那样日复一日地在种植园或磨坊里劳作。相反，吉马的奴隶虽然社会地位仍然较低，但他们可以担任狱卒、市场裁判、中央宫廷领地的管家等多种角色。他们是奥罗莫社会的宝贵组成部分，让他们继续发挥这种多功能的作用将有助于我们国家未来的繁荣。"

 affirm_oromo_might_desc: "过去的生存很艰难，但未来的生存呢？可能更艰难，也可能更容易。我们无法知道哪种可能性更大，但我们会抱最好的希望，做最坏的准备。奥罗莫人民会为了捍卫来之不易的独立战斗到底，他们不会轻易被任何周边势力征服。"

 linked_with_timbuktu_desc: "杰内的历史与辉煌的贸易城市廷巴克图有着内在的联系。我们都交易相似的商品，并且都因靠近河流的地理位置而繁荣。如果我们能够，基于这种重要性建立与所有邻国的互利贸易关系将是明智之举。"
 great_mosque_of_djenne: "杰内大清真寺"
 great_mosque_of_djenne_desc: "根据我们的传统，这座清真寺建于1200年至1300年之间，它逐渐成为了伊斯兰学术的中心，也是我们周边地区商人的灯塔。这样一个虔诚的象征在我们地区很少见，杰内真的很幸运能在我们的土地上拥有这样一座伟大的建筑。让我们继续参与穆斯林在各个地区之间进行的伟大对话，因为他们都将受到我们大清真寺的欢迎。"

 island_of_djenne_desc: "每年，巴尼河和尼日尔河都会开始季节性泛滥。从7月到12月，杰内变成了一个岛屿，周围土地的农作物灌溉也再次成为可能。我们依靠这种一年一度的洪水来获取一些财富，但也许我们可以更多地投资农业技术，以便种植更多的作物，或者种植不同且更有价值的作物。"
 adapt_to_changing_trade: "适应不断变化的贸易"
 adapt_to_changing_trade_desc: "随着来自南方和西方的沿海贸易逐渐兴起，我们需要确保自己的重要性不会下降。沿海贸易对人们来说比穿越平原和草原的贸易更容易参与，所以我们必须为商人数量减少的情况做好准备。通过让我们的商人和我们自己对贸易的思维方式适应西非贸易的这种演变，我们在贸易领域仍有一战之力。"
 refined_adobe_architecture: "改进我们的土坯建筑"
 refined_adobe_architecture_desc: "我们周围的许多人都知道杰内以其土坯建筑而闻名。使用泥砖在西非广为人知，在更干燥、更干旱的气候（如杰内）中是一种常见的建筑材料，因为它相对容易大量制作，并且在干燥条件下相当耐用。通过改进杰内的土坯建筑方式，我们可以加固建筑物，使其更加坚固，同时也能简化泥砖的制作过程。"
 build_upon_our_wealth: "杰内的财富"
 build_upon_our_wealth_desc: "繁荣来自知识与野心的结合，并通过商业来调节，至少杰内的一些富有的商人是这么说的。我们知道在一定程度上这是正确的，我们正在努力将从贸易和税收中获得的利润进行投资，以便我们未来的前景更加光明。新的贸易仓库、宏伟而实用的建筑以及著名的清真寺，这些都将在未来的杰内成为现实。"

 diverse_landscape: "多样的地貌"
 diverse_landscape_desc: "澳大利亚有的地方是起伏的草原，有的地方是恶劣的沙漠景观，甚至在一些孤立的地区还有宜人的草原，它是一个非常有趣且多面的土地。如果我们能够掌握季节变化，了解哪种作物在何种环境下生长最好，我们就可以为自己生产更多的食物，甚至可能还能出口到其他地方。"
 seafaring_is_our_lifeblood: "航海传统"
 seafaring_is_our_lifeblood_desc: "要到达澳大利亚，你必须有一定的航海传统，这只是这个地方的一个简单事实。因此，我们继承了家乡的传统，将航海视为澳大利亚整体的一个关键部分。有时确实需要士兵，但水手得到了大部分的训练和资金，这样我们就能确保海军实力不断增长，不受阻碍。"
 valued_trade_with_the_indies: "重要的北方贸易"
 valued_trade_with_the_indies_desc: "我们正北方是一些人所说的‘香料群岛’。那里的各个政治实体经常与我们进行良好的贸易往来，我们重视他们的合作，因为他们的丁香、黑胡椒和肉桂等香料深受澳大利亚人民的喜爱。也许我们最终甚至可以涉足香料贸易，因为澳大利亚多样的地貌可能适合种植某些香料。"
 expansive_australian_shipyards: "扩建造船厂"
 expansive_australian_shipyards_desc: "随着时间的推移，我们在海岸线上的定居点越来越多，在这个有趣的岛屿大陆上建立可持续国家的能力也在增强。不仅如此，我们还在逐步扩建许多港口和造船厂，以提高生产能力。生活在广袤澳大利亚的人们的海军实力将真正令人惊叹。"
 no_time_spent_being_idle: "一刻不得闲"
 no_time_spent_being_idle_desc: "有些人可能会因为我们想在澳大利亚这样的地方生活而称我们邪恶可怕，但我们不在乎这些琐碎的侮辱。相反，我们关心的是让我们控制的土地成为一个我们可以安全生活的地方，因为澳大利亚的大部分荒野可能有敌对的动物或敌对的原住民部落。我们的人民永远没有休息的时间，确实，恶人不得安息。"
 master_the_australian_terrain: "征服澳大利亚内陆"
 master_the_australian_terrain_desc: "一旦我们征服了澳大利亚内陆及其恶劣的环境，我们就能抵御任何想要入侵我们土地的侵略者。我们将利用自然和人工防御工事阻止侵略者入侵我们的土地，如果我们能够在跨海的外国土地上占据据点，我们也会利用那里的自然防御工事，在每一个环节打断敌人的行动。"

 criollos: "克里奥尔人议会"
 criollos_desc: "对我们中美洲人来说，克里奥尔人是那些几乎拥有纯正母国血统，但出生在我们这里，而不是在我们曾经效忠的遥远土地上的人。这些克里奥尔人在我们争取独立的过程中发挥了领导作用，我们将继续支持他们团结民众，对抗那些打击中美洲统一省份的势力。"
 stave_off_bloodshed: "减少流血，增进团结"
 stave_off_bloodshed_desc: "无论我们走向独立的道路多么血腥，我们都需要昂首挺胸，超越过去的血腥历史。在我们的行政管理中避免不必要的流血事件，促进共同身份认同的纽带，这是中美洲这些省份所需要的，而不是来自小霸主的持续暴政和残酷对待。"
 liberal_minded_locals: "思想开明的当地人"
 liberal_minded_locals_desc: "不仅我们的议会和行政机构思想开明，我们的当地人在很大程度上也是如此。他们从我们前统治者那里（无论是严厉还是温和地）学到了经验教训，形成了一种非常独特且开明的思维方式，我们周边很少有国家能拥有或模仿这种思维方式。虽然这可能会因为政治辩论和阴谋在未来引发紧张局势，但我们应该尽可能采纳其中一些想法，不要丝毫阻碍它们的发展。"
 resolve_regional_disputes: "解决地区分歧"
 resolve_regional_disputes_desc: "如果说有一件事一直困扰着这些统一省份的行政管理，那就是各个社区之间的地区差异不断出现，导致从基层开始的无休止的派系斗争。如果我们要让民众对我们的官员及其能力建立持久的信心，就需要制定更有效、更全面的法律和法规，以约束我们的各个社区。"
 proper_city_connections: "完善的通信网络"
 proper_city_connections_desc: "为了更好地促进中美洲各社区之间，以及不同省级办公室之间的旅行和通信，我们将建立一种固定的道路系统，并制定邮政服务的规划和方案。如果我们能够及时有效地做到这一点，不仅平民能够更快地出行和交流，我们的军队和官员也能做到同样的事情。"
 constitutional_reforms: "乐于改革"
 constitutional_reforms_desc: "如果我们不乐于改变，会怎样呢？我们的前统治者拒绝接受我们想要的变革，所以现在我们掌握了独立的火炬，我们可以并且愿意按照自己认为合适的方式改革我们的法律体系和行政机构。"
 united_provinces_in_reality: "真正统一的省份"
 united_provinces_in_reality_desc: "最终，我们会不惜一切代价确保我们保持统一。我们不能在面对前殖民统治者重新获得他们曾经拥有的权力，或者新的殖民统治者寻求在中美洲获得可行的土地时冒险分裂。当我们从上到下的行政管理有效且高效时，中美洲联合省份的其他一切事务都会步入正轨。"

 indigenous_assistance: "原住民的帮助"
 indigenous_assistance_desc: "这片土地上的原住民在战斗中非常勇猛，尽管在我们还是一个年轻殖民地时，他们逐渐被我们的军队征服。现在我们可以以我们认为合适的方式利用原住民，最好是将他们平等地纳入哥伦比亚的军事体系，这样他们就能为我们参与的任何战争做出贡献。"
 balance_liberals_and_conservatives: "平衡自由派和保守派"
 balance_liberals_and_conservatives_desc: "随着我们的独立，有许多团体为哥伦比亚提出了各种想法。自由派的想法和保守派的想法都很有吸引力，但如果我们选择一条道路，就不能冒险疏远国家的一部分人。我们必须努力在哥伦比亚的这两种思想流派之间找到平衡。"
 martial_skill_from_our_parents: "保持军事实力"
 martial_skill_from_our_parents_desc: "我们的前统治者在殖民这片土地时非常注重一件事：军事实力。这就是他们能够击败原住民并征服整个土地的原因。如果我们希望在哥伦比亚保持领先地位，并为外部和内部威胁做好准备，就需要确保我们的军队做好准备。"
 colombian_coasts: "哥伦比亚海岸"
 colombian_coasts_desc: "哥伦比亚的海岸是重要的贸易场所，也是人们交流的地方，但由于我们缺乏造船厂和码头，它们总是有些脆弱。如果我们能在海岸线上投入更多的时间和资金，就能确保我们的贸易中心更加安全。"
 hill_and_jungle_warfare: "哥伦比亚的战斗"
 hill_and_jungle_warfare_desc: "如果有人要在哥伦比亚的腹地战斗，那就是要在潮湿的雨中、崎岖的地形中战斗。什么样的士兵能够长时间在这样的环境中战斗呢？当然只有哥伦比亚人，这就是为什么我们学会了使战斗风格适应这种地形。"
 in_union_and_in_peace_with_each_other: "团结与和平"
 in_union_and_in_peace_with_each_other_desc: "如果说我们哥伦比亚人追求的只有一件事，那就是：彼此团结与和平。考虑到国际政治可能会有多混乱，这当然是一个崇高的目标，但我们必须努力在哥伦比亚广袤的土地上维护法律和秩序，然后再向其他领域扩张，进行征服或解放其他殖民地。"

 abundance_of_food_yearround: "丰富的食物"
 abundance_of_food_yearround_desc: "即使没有农业，加利福尼亚也有大量的食物。在我们到来之前，生活在这片土地上的原住民依靠自然环境繁衍生息，无需农业。如果我们能像他们一样善于寻找食物，就能养活比我们祖先认为可能的多得多的人口。"

 come_to_peace_with_native_californians_desc: "尽管我们的人口逐年增加，但加利福尼亚的原住民部落和人民仍然拥有很大一部分土地，我们不能忽视他们。与他们和平相处、合作是决定加利福尼亚兴衰的关键。如果我们国家内部团结，很少有人能阻挡我们走向伟大。"
 the_problem_of_agriculture: "农业问题"
 the_problem_of_agriculture_desc: "随着越来越多的人来到加利福尼亚定居，以及越来越多的加利福尼亚人通过婚姻和生育诞生，大规模发展农业将成为必然需求。为了满足不断增长的人口需求，需要开垦农场和庄园，现在就开始行动，而不是等到以后，这样我们就能在未来几十年甚至几个世纪中占据优势。"

 tame_the_rugid_inlands_desc: "加利福尼亚是一个地貌多样的地方。从草原到森林，从山丘到沙漠，我们在一定程度上拥有所有这些地貌，我们需要学会通过民用定居点和军事力量来掌控这些地形。在不同地形的关键地点建造防御工事，有助于训练我们的士兵，也能提高我们在这片广阔而美丽的土地上的通信速度。"
 the_advantage_of_bays: "加利福尼亚的海湾"
 the_advantage_of_bays_desc: "海岸对加利福尼亚的重要性就如同黄金对全球贸易的重要性一样。我们依靠贸易繁荣发展，而通过我们的天然港口和海湾，不利用它们将是愚蠢的！如果我们在这些靠近天然海湾和港口的城市进行建设，我们获得的收入将超过我们前统治者认为加利福尼亚可能获得的水平。"
 the_gold_rush: "淘金热？"
 the_gold_rush_desc: "有有趣的报道称在加利福尼亚内陆的各个地方发现了金矿，虽然我们无法证实大多数这些发现和报道，但我们能够证实的那些可以吸引大量的定居者和矿工来到我们的土地。他们愿意支付所需的费用进入并开始淘金，那么为什么不利用这股可能带来未来商人的涌入潮赚钱呢？"

 hostile_encounters_along_the_mississippi_desc: "无论是在密西西比河上还是在其附近的河岸，我们经历了多次冲突，这让我们的军队学会了如何应对我们所居住的这条大河。在大河附近战斗时，骑兵和炮兵的作用相对较小，步兵才是战斗的核心，正因如此，我们的士兵是该地区最坚韧的一批人。"
 regular_river_crossing: "频繁的渡河行动"
 regular_river_crossing_desc: "对于指挥官来说，跨越伟大的密西西比河并非易事，但只要有足够的物资和努力，肯定是可以做到的。我们需要训练未来的指挥官轻松应对大大小小的渡河行动，这样他们就能利用渡河行动为自己创造优势，或者消除渡河对他们参与的战斗可能产生的重大影响。"
 starting_of_plantations: "路易斯安那的种植园"
 starting_of_plantations_desc: "路易斯安那的农业，尤其是向南靠近大海的地区，很难发展，因为沼泽地和湿地根本不适合大规模的农场和种植园。我们需要在路易斯安那更适宜的地区开辟土地，开始建设合适的种植园和农场，这样我们就能大规模生产粮食。也许随着时间的推移，我们还能在新的种植园里种植其他作物。"
 sustainable_harbors: "可持续的港口"
 sustainable_harbors_desc: "为了拥有一支合适的海军，我们需要合适的港口和造船厂。在大多数其他沿海地区，这可能不是问题，但对于路易斯安那及其湿地来说，我们需要在港口和造船厂的建设上发挥创造力。我们需要建造一些结构良好的建筑，使其能够在不太理想的地形上使用，一旦我们获得了一些优质的沿海土地，也需要确保那里的港口和造船厂以类似的方式建造。"
 vie_for_gulf_control: "争夺海湾控制权"
 vie_for_gulf_control_desc: "控制我们正南方海湾的贸易是我们的首要任务，因为我们的很多贸易都要经过那里。如果我们能用自己的船只确保海湾安全，抵御敌对势力，包括新大陆的其他独立国家和大洋彼岸的旧国家，我们就能处于一个极好的位置来掌控周围的所有贸易。"
 the_marshland_masters: "沼泽地的主宰者"
 the_marshland_masters_desc: "我们在路易斯安那恶劣地形上进行的战斗和对土地的开发，使我们成为了坚韧勤劳的人民。我们的前殖民统治者可能认为我们只是一群需要最终安分守己的小暴发户，但我们会让他们知道他们对路易斯安那人的看法有多错误。让他们登陆我们的海岸，然后让他们淹没在自己与海水混合的鲜血中。"
 harbinger_of_the_mississippi_river: "密西西比河"
 harbinger_of_the_mississippi_river_desc: "伟大的密西西比河是我们所在地区的一个非常显著的特征，也许也是路易斯安那本身的关键特征。如此多的人依靠它生活，并通过贸易赚钱，我们要是试图将其据为己有，那可就太愚蠢了。我们应该吸引尽可能多的商人，邀请他们来分享这条伟大的密西西比河的荣耀。"

 establish_the_office_of_supreme_director: "设立最高总监职位"
 establish_the_office_of_supreme_director_desc: "我们不能让仅仅因为地位和财富而掌权的一小撮人统治国家。我们需要一个由选举产生的议会，此外，还需要有人带领阿根廷走向未来。未来的新选举将不再任命‘总督’这样的殖民头衔，而是选出阿根廷联合省份的最高总监。"
 confederation_vs_federation: "邦联制还是联邦制？"
 confederation_vs_federation_desc: "阿根廷国内许多人就中央行政机构应如何治理各省展开辩论，大致可分为两类：统一派和联邦派。无论我们选择统一派支持的邦联制道路，还是联邦派提议的联邦制，我们都需要保卫阿根廷，抵御外部威胁和试图扼杀阿根廷自由之火的殖民势力；在这方面，有无数勇士随时准备拿起武器为独立而战。"

 defeat_secessionits_movements_desc: "阿根廷并非一个整齐划一、易于治理的国家，远非如此。有几个地方存在争端，如果要在国家整体发展方面取得任何进展，就需要进行调解和解决，那些企图从阿根廷分裂出去的人将不会得到我们的怜悯。"

 settle_federalist_vs_centralist_disputes_desc: "我们这个年轻国家的政治动荡而激烈，但从一场反抗前殖民统治者的战争中诞生，人们还能期待什么呢？我们需要努力缓解不同政治派别之间的紧张关系，确保阿根廷的治理机构有能力应对各种形式的腐败。"
 suppress_counter_revolutionaries: "镇压反革命狂热分子"
 suppress_counter_revolutionaries_desc: "有人说这不可能，但现实很少如我们所愿。确实有一些人会起来反对阿根廷，将其重新交回到我们前殖民统治者贪婪的手中。这些反革命分子是对阿根廷最严重的威胁之一，每当他们出现时，我们都需要在各个方面与他们进行斗争。他们对一个独立的阿根廷缺乏信心，我们会让他们知道他们错得有多离谱。"
 watch_for_caudillos: "警惕考迪罗"
 watch_for_caudillos_desc: "考迪罗，在我们的土地上有点忌讳的一个词。它代表着那些企图自上而下按照自己的意愿和对其绝对忠诚的人的意志进行统治的军国主义政客。我们需要警惕这些可恶的人在阿根廷行政机构中崛起，因为如果他们掌控了政府，独立统一的阿根廷的整个梦想可能会轻易破灭。"

 chilean_finances_desc: "一段时间以来，智利的财政状况一直很艰难，因为智利的土地不像南美洲其他地区那样拥有丰富的财富。这种困境帮助智利的经济学家和金融家学会了如何在有限的优质土地上减少开支、增加利润，更重要的是，他们学会了如何精简军事开支，避免资金浪费。"
 establish_chilean_schooling: "接受教育"

 appeal_to_tolerance_not_tradition: "谁需要国教？"
 appeal_to_tolerance_not_tradition_desc: "智利的建立或许源于殖民地独立运动的烈火，但智利也必须考虑未来，而不是仅仅停留在过去。以前我们到处都能看到国教的强制推行，但智利真的需要国教吗？我们必须在这个问题上更加开明，更多地倡导宽容而非传统，因为正是这种开明的思想帮助我们获得了独立。"
 spearhead_liberal_ideas: "引领自由思想"
 spearhead_liberal_ideas_desc: "在生活的许多方面保持开明的心态，对我们的许多前统治者来说是陌生的，但在智利，这种心态被广泛接受。有些人批评我们的思维和生活方式过于自由，与我们的传统不同，但我们将以富有思想性的辩论和讨论来回应这些批评，而不是用刀剑和武器。"

 intermarry_and_intermix_desc: "我们周围的其他人可能认为应该向原住民开枪并消灭他们，但我们巴拉圭人认为完全没有必要这样做。他们是这片土地不可或缺的一部分，比我们更早来到这里，他们应该得到比奴隶制更高的尊重和尊严。我们将确保他们得到保护，并融入巴拉圭，我们的国家也会因此变得更强大。"

 reforming_the_paraguayan_economy_desc: "巴拉圭的独立是一个棘手的问题，因为我们所在的地区并非最有利可图或最有价值的地区。我们必须在财务上更加负责，在财政上更具可行性，这样巴拉圭的经济才能持续增长，而不是停滞或衰退。我们该如何做到这一点呢？通过积极的改革措施，从货币改革到贸易政策修订等各个方面。"
 legacy_of_the_open_cabildo: "开放市政会议的遗产"
 legacy_of_the_open_cabildo_desc: "相当于‘开放市政厅’的开放市政会议，在一定程度上帮助巴拉圭获得了独立。源于地方的努力逐渐影响到行政机构等，我们需要在巴拉圭继续举行这些市政会议，以帮助从社区层面规范行政管理。"
 cultivate_paraguays_heart: "培育巴拉圭的核心"
 cultivate_paraguays_heart_desc: "归根结底，巴拉圭是南美洲的一个小国，需要更多地依靠自己来实现发展。虽然这并不容易，但如果我们能够成功应对动荡的政治局势，抵御外国入侵，巴拉圭的行政管理将成为南美洲运作最高效的行政管理之一。"

 pacific_bound_trade_desc: "太平洋贸易利润丰厚，特别是随着能够远航的船只变得越来越普遍。投资秘鲁沿海的港口无疑将促进贸易部门的发展，因为我们已经是美洲主要的太平洋贸易国之一。"
 center_at_the_city_of_kings: "宣告王者之城"
 center_at_the_city_of_kings_desc: "我们的城市被当地人昵称为‘王者之城’，考虑到我们对治理的开明思想以及我们的独立战争本身，这个名字可能有点奇怪，但它象征着一座统治秘鲁及其所有居民（包括原住民和非原住民）的城市的崛起。它将是一座受到公民和政治家共同拥护的光荣城市，没有人能够将其摧毁。"

 work_through_racial_divides_desc: "委内瑞拉的殖民历史并非全然美好，因为我们继承了前宗主国在其本土的诸多做法。一个尤为棘手的问题就是种族分歧，如今这一问题已浮出委内瑞拉的政治表面。随着我们走向未来，我们需要通过立法措施和稳步的行政改革来解决这些问题。"
 royalists_in_venezuela: "击败保皇派"
 royalists_in_venezuela_desc: "在委内瑞拉，我们无法容忍保皇派情绪。保皇派势力不仅分布在我国境外，还渗透到我国的各个社区。有时，他们认为自己能够推翻委内瑞拉的执政机构。我们将向他们展示我们权威的正义性，以及赢得委内瑞拉民心所需的纪律性。"

 charting_out_a_venezuelan_future_desc: "未来对所有人来说都充满了不确定性，对委内瑞拉而言更是如此。如果我们要为人民创造一个可持续且繁荣的未来，就必须审视我们自己的城市和城镇，了解他们的需求。一旦我们能够为人民提供他们所渴望的基础设施，我们就能够向境外国家伸出友谊之手。"

 knowledge_of_raids_and_privateering_desc: "自我们走向独立以来，海地人民（包括平民和士兵）目睹了周边地区野蛮的作战方式。在陆地和海上进行劫掠，在敌人反应过来之前迅速撤离，这种方式虽然不光彩，但却十分有效！我们在独立斗争中采用的这些战术，应该成为我们在未来战斗中常用的策略！"

 lucrative_plantations_of_haiti_desc: "尽管独立使海地陆地和沿海地区的经济活动略有下降，但我们仍然是一个盈利的国家。在未来几十年里，改进和修复种植园、实现农作物多样化，以及实施现代化的经济改革，将有助于让海地经济重现生机。"

 sca_dominate_the_baltic_desc: "从某些标准来看，波罗的海是一个危险的海域。在过去的时代，它由来自德国北部的汉萨同盟主导，但斯堪的纳维亚人和俄罗斯人也一直参与波罗的海贸易。现在斯堪的纳维亚已经统一，我们应该派遣商人与商船队遍布整个波罗的海，为自己争取更多的贸易机会，剥夺竞争对手从这些贸易路线中获得的宝贵收入，这些路线理应被称为‘斯堪的纳维亚海’。"

 sca_reformation_administration_desc: "封建制度在欧洲许多地区已走向尽头，尽管不公正的君主和主教们试图维持旧的社会秩序，无视治理方面的新进展以及在整个欧洲传播的新思想。斯堪的纳维亚不应执着于封建过去，而应展望未来，调整其行政机构，以适应有关政治、外交和军事事务的新思想。"

 sweden_manage_the_estates_desc: "瑞典核心地区拥有强大势力基础的各个庄园，对整个斯堪的纳维亚的生存至关重要。虽然我们能够轻松应对丹麦、挪威、芬兰和萨米人的庄园，但瑞典的庄园持续拥有巨大的权力，我们必须在未来努力平衡这种权力。"
 sweden_caroleans: "卡罗林军团登场"
 sweden_caroleans_desc: "整个斯堪的纳维亚的人力和资源，无法与神圣罗马帝国、法国或奥斯曼帝国相比。我们必须学会创新，充分利用现有资源，并从士兵身上挖掘出更多潜力。因此，我们的军事战略和战术需要从防御转向进攻，用专业、纪律严明的高素质士兵，取代单纯依靠数量的持久作战能力，而瑞典地区将引领斯堪的纳维亚进入一个新的军事时代。"

 sweden_absolutism_from_stockholm_desc: "斯堪的纳维亚各地有许多城市和城镇，都渴望拥有自己独特的身份，并从斯德哥尔摩的王室获得自治权，但我们真的能允许这种情况发生吗？君主确实可能受到所统治人民的制约，但整个行政机构的法律必须被斯堪的纳维亚境内所有具有重要地位的城镇遵守。我们要确保地方当局能够清楚地了解斯德哥尔摩政府通过的具体立法。"

 denmark_kalmar_union_lessons_desc: "1397年，丹麦的玛格丽特一世女王和波美拉尼亚的埃里克努力促成了卡尔马联盟，这是整个斯堪的纳维亚历史上的一个关键时刻。当时没人能预见它会对我们的政治和外交关系产生怎样的影响，但它成功实现了主要目标：阻止德国向北扩张到波罗的海和斯堪的纳维亚地区。然而，联盟的发展并非一帆风顺，联盟内三个主要民族群体之间存在许多问题，最终从各个方面瓦解了联盟。我们将从这段历史中吸取教训，进行改革，确保类似的联盟不再瓦解。"

 denmark_the_legacy_of_cnut_desc: "丹麦试图统一斯堪的纳维亚及其他地区的历史，不仅可以追溯到卡尔马联盟时期，还可以追溯到克努特大帝时代。统一斯堪的纳维亚和英伦诸岛的土地是一项艰巨的任务，克努特的继任者们的失败令人羞愧，但他们留下了宝贵的遗产：征服的传统。丹麦人民的热血并不满足于仅仅成为斯堪的纳维亚的主导力量，不，他们渴望向外扩张，夺回属于斯堪的纳维亚人民的土地，甚至更多！"
 denmark_commandeer_trade: "斯堪的纳维亚的公平份额"
 denmark_commandeer_trade_desc: "尽管我们非常看重多年来一直受到德国北部海岸争议的松德海峡通行税，但我们还需要控制更多的贸易路线和市场，以在更多地方加强斯堪的纳维亚的影响力；同时，这也能增加流入我们国库的财富。一旦更多的贸易地点得到保障，我们可以通过建立庞大的商人和贸易网络来提升这些地方的价值，同时与附近的邻国建立牢固的关系（前提是它们对我们没有敌意）。"

 finland_hakkapeliitat_desc: "尽管我们在一定程度上怨恨瑞典人过去对我们的冒犯，但芬兰人民的军事力量已经接过了瑞典人似乎天生就有的军事主动权。轻骑兵的发展在斯堪的纳维亚军队的芬兰部队中逐渐扎根，这些轻骑兵部队提出的座右铭‘hakkaa päälle!’（‘砍倒他们！’），正是他们所擅长的：对敌人进行迅速而无情的冲锋、进行残酷而精准的突袭，以及为军事行动进行巧妙的侦察。"
 finland_listen_to_the_peasantry: "倾听农民的声音"
 finland_listen_to_the_peasantry_desc: "由于种种原因，农民在斯堪的纳维亚往往没有得到公平的代表，但在芬兰的土地上，农民的地位略高，拥有的权力也比瑞典、丹麦或挪威的农民稍大。为什么会这样呢？因为我们知道，他们和斯堪的纳维亚的贵族与商人一样，也有需要被倾听的想法和观点。将这种思维方式推广到我们的政府中，能够并且将会使政府更加灵活，能够解决我们境内许多群体的关切。"
 finland_extensive_defenses: "冰与石"
 finland_extensive_defenses_desc: "虽然‘白色死神’（严寒）使斯堪的纳维亚北部地区相当安全，但像维堡这样坚固的防御工事的任务是在气候较暖和的时候抵御敌人。如果我们能够在整个斯堪的纳维亚建造更强大、更广泛的防御工事，同时利用季节优势，那么世界上将没有任何国家能够深入斯堪的纳维亚腹地超过几个省份。"
 sapmi_swift_movements: "快速行动"
 sapmi_swift_movements_desc: "如果说北方的萨米人给斯堪的纳维亚的军官们心中灌输了一件事，那就是快速而精准的行动绝对至关重要。午夜太阳之地不会怜悯那些犹豫不决的人，战争中的敌人也是如此。机动性将是斯堪的纳维亚人取得军事成功的最大因素。"
 sapmi_noaidi_traditions: "The Noaidi Traditions"
 sapmi_noaidi_traditions_desc: "The fires of religious war in Europe's heart is a raging inferno that the Sapmi have wanted no part in. The noaidi, Sapmi shamans who are the religious heads of the polytheistic Sapmi religion, bring a much needed example of tolerance in the times of religious turmoil. We can look to them for guidance and learn to accept other faiths into the fold of Scandinavia without compromising its ability to govern or defend itself from invasions."
 sapmi_fairness_to_nomads_and_settlers: "Equality to Nomads and Settlers"
 sapmi_fairness_to_nomads_and_settlers_desc: "Many of the Sapmi people are content with their semi-nomadic reindeer herding in the far north of Scandinavia. Though some Swedish, Norwegian, and Danish officials think it would be better if we forced these semi-nomadic people to settle down, we realize that it is in the best interest of Scandinavia if they keep to their own and are treated fairly under the government. They can help keep order in their own parts of Scandinavia if they are treated fairly and we will ensure that there is a permanent peace between the nomads and settlers of Scandinavia."
 ice_ruthless_fleet: "The Ruthless Fleet"
 ice_ruthless_fleet_desc: "The fleets of Scandinavia that dock not only in the cold ports of Iceland and the warmer ports along the Danish, Swedish, and Norwegian coast knows no bounds. Shaped from having to fend off countless commerce raids and various conflicts throughout the North Sea and elsewhere, the fleet of Scandinavia will be like no other, for when one ship falls in battle, it only grows more bolder in its actions in the heat of things."
 ice_norse_endurance: "Norse Endurance"
 ice_norse_endurance_desc: "If we can endure the cold weather of Scandinavia stretching from the Land of the Midnight Sun all the way to Icelandic mountains and fjords, what can't we endure? Sure the enemy may tire out our armies in battle and seek to invade our lands, but Scandinavian people know that they must not give in and they must never give the enemy any advantage if possible. We fight to the very end, just as our Norse ancestors did."
 ice_althing_legislation: "Legacy of the Althing"
 ice_althing_legislation_desc: "The Althing, though somewhat outdated in these modern times, can still be useful on the local level of things. Icelandic ways of governance might be foreign to some Finnish, Sapmi, and Danish people, but we can introduce them to it over time and work on refining how the Althing functions as time goes on. It would certainly help build up a robust local governance structure that we can rely on."

 haven_for_freed_slaves: "Freed Slaves are Welcome"
 haven_for_freed_slaves_desc: "Florida has many small corridors and vacant plots of land that are rarely traversed by anyone from the government or from the military, making for a great amount of hiding places for slaves that are fleeing from their home or that have escaped captivity. We of Florida will gladly welcome these escaped people to our state and open our borders to them if they agree to some initial paperwork to formalize their entry. The more people we have, the better!"
 marshland_fighting: "Fighting in the Marshes"
 marshland_fighting_desc: "Florida's heartland is a humid places with very little in the way of mercy from the damp and hot climate. The natives here were used to the conditions and put up a fierce fight when we came to colonize the region and not long after we arrived, we learned just how crucial their fighting styles would be to our own survival. Fighting in the marshes is no easy task, but we are masters of it at this point and are able to resist massed musket fire like no other."
 deal_with_heat_and_insects: "Insects... And Heat..."
 deal_with_heat_and_insects_desc: "The insects of Florida are ruthless in the pain they cause and the diseases they spread! Whole communities can come down with debilitating diseases because of these menacing pests coupled with the heat and indeed we've lost thousands to them in the past, but it is through these painful experiences that we grow stronger. We are developing methods to stave off the threat of insects as well as to mitigate the impact that the heat and humidity has. Our civilians as well as our soldiers must adapt over time to how harsh this land is."
 formalize_hemp_sugarcane_indigo_growth: "Floridian Crops"
 formalize_hemp_sugarcane_indigo_growth_desc: "Our land is ripe for growing hemp, sugar, and indigo, but we can only utilize so much of the land for our crops before trying to go to war for more land. Perhaps we can expand our reach inland and carve out more places for plantations and farms through land development. It'll take years to do, but in time we should see a general rise in how much we produce and how well our economy can do on the world stage."
 scattered_yet_plentiful_fortifications: "Outposts and Watchtowers"
 scattered_yet_plentiful_fortifications_desc: "Castles and bastions with great walls of stone are few and far between in the Floridian heartland since the ground to build on is often wet, unstable, and prone to changes over the years. That is why we build several fortified outposts and watchtowers equipped with skilled shooters and runners for communication, and on top of all that these defensive structures are much easier to build than a normal castle. We'd do well to continue building these light defenses in the future to help slow down any advancing enemies."
 floridian_harbors: "Floridian Harbors"
 floridian_harbors_desc: "Whilst we have marshy terrain all around our heartland, we have waters of all kinds around us that are fit for trade and combat. Being that so much potential for Florida lies not just in its land and people but also out at sea, we should be keen on building up suitable harbors and docks for our fleet of ships. There is plenty of suitable coastline to start with so, we're already a step ahead of some regions nearby."
 social_mobility_for_slaves_and_natives: "Social Mobility"
 social_mobility_for_slaves_and_natives_desc: "Natives and freed slaves in our lands cannot be held back forever by our culture and government since they can provide so much in the form of taxes, production, and military manpower. If we build schools and libraries, we can also help these people rise through the society to become great Floridian administrators, but in order for any of this to happen, we need to embark on a policy of change and reform that staunchly encourages social mobility."

 organized_settlement_of_land_desc: "If we can organized the land of Illinois and how the Illinoisan people settle on it, we can gain so much more in the form of tax revenue in the years to come. Along with that going for us later on, we can promote the proper development of the land via organized cutting down of various woodlands and the cultivation of specially designated crop areas."
 combat_against_natives: "When We Must Fight"
 combat_against_natives_desc: "Though it hasn't been often that we of Illinois are needed to fight extensively, we have been called upon to defend our own settlements from various native tribes in the past and even to this day. We must be sure that we have enough troops to man the defensive structures we have and to also do battle with any enemy force that seeks to destroy what we've worked so hard to build up over the decades."
 utilize_water_ways: "The Ease of Rivers"
 utilize_water_ways_desc: "Rivers, where would be without rivers? They're a great way of transporting goods to far away places with less work (most of the time), they provide a source of water to us, and they also help indicate where other potentially friendly settlements might be. The more we can use the rivers to our advantage in terms of trade and business deals, the better off we will be as a whole."
 tenuous_borders: "Finding the Real Borders"
 tenuous_borders_desc: "Due to where we are situated, borders are less cut-and-dry compared to other places that are more heavily inhabited by dense cities and dedicated roads. As a result, we're often redefining where our borders are at the local level with various communities and towns on the border with our neighbors. When push comes to shove and war breaks out though, we can use this to our advantage and use some very favorable maps at the peace conference that allow us to take even more land."
 wealth_over_war: "Wealth Over War"
 wealth_over_war_desc: "If we can avoid war, we'd rather do so than take our chances with our economy and investments. By focusing our economy and administration more so on internal development and the securing of trade deals from various regions nearby our own, we'll be able to get a greater amount of overall wealth than we would've gotten through wars that could go any which way."

 fortification_at_our_front_desc: "We will defend what is rightfully ours to the very end. The gold and silver we've brought into our treasury and the wealth we've created for our citizens, it will not be robbed by the greedy hands of war or other disasters.

 urbanize_further_desc: "Our island is large enough and also flat enough to support larger cities in comparison to what other islands around the Caribbean can support. Because of this, we have gained a great number of settlers over the decades both before and after our independence. These settlers will be useful in not only expanding Cuban military measures and economic aspects, but they will also help develop new settlements all across our central island and beyond."
 centralize_governance_in_cuba: "Strong Central Governance"
 centralize_governance_in_cuba_desc: "Cuba is a place of splendor and majesty, but also a place of strong central authority and governance. Even before we gained independence, we had a strong administration that oversaw the entirety of Cuban domains so that the rise in the amount of settlers coming to our land would be organized properly. We will keep this legacy of central authority and without a doubt enforce our laws and legislation with fairness all throughout Cuba."
 caribbean_trade_hub: "Centrality of Caribbean Trade"
 caribbean_trade_hub_desc: "We are in the heart of the lucrative Caribbean trade network and we stand to benefit from commanding and investing in the various trade routes that go through our waters and across our central island. As time goes on, we will ensure that our profits will only increase thanks to our protection and beneficial investments along the trade routes in our grasp, and perhaps in time we could reach out to different regions of trade and start making money there as well."
 defend_cuban_waters: "Cuban Waters"
 defend_cuban_waters_desc: "We have seen battle after battle take place near our shores with various fleets being destroyed and whole crews of sailors going down into the murky depths below. Cuba is not safe without a navy nor a military, but if we cannot protect our coasts from imperial colonizers like our former overlord, what good are we as a nation? We will make it known that the waters around our central island are Cuban waters, defended by the grandest fleet in the entire Caribbean."
 trade_with_new_world_polities: "New World Trade Deals"
 trade_with_new_world_polities_desc: "With our independence secured and the wars for independence raging on throughout the various parts of the New World, we should take the time to start investing in these upcoming states who are fighting for their own rights and values. We are a much better trade partner for them than the colonial overlords that seek only to extract wealth from colonial entities, so we can go forth with some safety knowing that we will be seen in a more favorable light."
 learn_advanced_naval_strategy: "Uphold the Cuban Fleet"
 learn_advanced_naval_strategy_desc: "Naval strategy and the perfection of it over time is tough, but Cuba is uniquely situated to be at the forefront of this endeavor. Defending our waters and engaging in various wars that involve conflicts on the high seas will continually breed stronger and more adept admirals and sailors who know exactly what to do in the midst of a broadside battle. We have faith that our fleet can withstand whatever comes their way in the future."
 armed_at_all_times: "Never Surrender"
 armed_at_all_times_desc: "And should any enemy land on Cuban shores, they will find not a welcoming local population that takes them in without trouble. Instead, they will find a population of righteous people armed with muskets and rifles, willing to fight to keep the liberty that was gained so many years ago. There will be no mercy when an enemy steps foot into our land, just like they would have no mercy on us if Cubans were to do the same."

 a_crimson_laden_culture_desc: "We are very distinct from our neighbors in a number of ways, but perhaps the most blatant way we are different is through the distinctly red colored clothing we wear and our red wall paintings and murals. Few other places have the resource that can make such brilliant red dye and it is because of this rarity and how we use the red dye that others come to see us as a better diplomatic partner. Perhaps red can become the standard royalty?"
 diarchical_administration: "Diarchical Administration"
 diarchical_administration_desc: "Ichma administration is divided into two parts roughly: the 'anan (upper) saya ichma' and the 'luran (lower) saya ichma', which represent the upper communities in the highlands and the lower communities closer to the coast. Because the coastal communities are much more vital to the survival of our state, they have traditionally held more sway over government matters, but we must work to continually enforce balanced legislative rules and pass laws that benefit all communities when possible."

 adorn_the_dead_desc: "The dead of Ichma must not be sent off with nothing but dirt and rocks at their side, no, that would be degrading their worth! They must their valuables and jewels buried with them, at least partly, so that their journey to the afterlife is not a dark and burdensome one. In this way, we honor our recently deceased men and women and bring peace to their body at least in this realm. We only hope that in the next realm, they are as well off as they were here."

 ichma_pyramids_of_devotion_desc: "How can we contact the divine? How can we properly ascertain their messages and send messages back to them? It is certainly not out in the open with harsh conditions beating down at us whilst we are the midst of the gods, so the pyramids of our ancestors can do just fine. It will not be only those pyramids though, for we can build more as time goes on in other places where the Ichma people settle down into."

 unite_the_confederacies_of_old_desc: "The breakup of the Wari Empire was long ago, but we remember rightly that the Ichma people came about in the ashes of the burning state. Not only us, but many others got their start when the Wari Empire began to burn, leading to several confederacies of people forming afterwards. Some may still be around and some may have been conquered, but we of Ichma must do what we can to reunite the old lands of the Wari Empire."

 huaca_of_the_ichma_desc: "A huaca is something of a monument, sometimes natural and sometimes man-made, that is revered by not only our people but also by other people around us. Some huaca are known to have rituals of veneration and devotion dedicated to them whilst others are along pilgrimage routes for our various gods. The more huaca we can get under our control, the more unified and satiated our people will be."

 successor_to_the_wari_people_desc: "The memories of the old Wari Empire fade away as time goes on; their old cities and artificats are not going to be around forever, but what they put forth can still be a foundation to build upon. Let us renew the efforts of the Wari people of old and pick up where they left off, triumphing over disasters that come our way and military foes who seek to dismantle our power."

 tholing_tabo_and_khochar_monasteries_desc: "Yeshe-Ö, the second king after our founding, was perhaps the greatest leader from our past. Through his work of leading the second revival of Buddhism in Tibetan lands, sponsoring novice monastic people to travel to different lands, and constructing some of the most revered monuments in all of Tibet, we of Guge are well known and have gained a great amount of influence. But, his work was not militarily secured and Guge remained a rather small kingdom despite his grandeur, thus leaving us with merely prestigious structures that survive to now such as the three monasteries."
 old_city_of_tsaparang: "The City of Tsaparang"
 old_city_of_tsaparang_desc: "Though it was not always our capital, Tsaparang has become a haven for the rulers of Guge. It has slowly been built up over time due partially to the fact that successful claimants in civil wars centering around Tsaparang instead of Tholing, meaning that today Tsaparang is something that inspires both faith in the ruler of Guge and trust in their governance."
 kingdom_of_tibetan_buddhism_revival: "The Revivers of Tibetan Buddhism"
 kingdom_of_tibetan_buddhism_revival_desc: "There is one key title that we of Guge hold: the revivers of Tibetan Buddhism. The form of Buddhism that took root in Tibet changed and morphed over the centuries due to various influences such as shifting borders in the Tarim Basin and ambitions to conquer land whilst also controlling politics at home in the mountainous cities of Lhasa, Dege, Shigatse, and many others. When it looked like the flame of Buddhism in our land was about to be extinguished, it was the rulers of Guge who gave renewed life to the flame, and it is this period of revival that many still know us for."
 strive_for_religious_education: "Religious Education"
 strive_for_religious_education_desc: "Though education is seen as necessary to progress in life by many, few in Guge are able to actually become literate and fully capable of being productive in life despite being fully fledged Buddhists. Let us work to change this as time goes on and promote the building of not only monasteries in our lands, but also libraries and schools that focus on Buddhist texts and also other subjects such as mathematics and geography."

 ready_to_reform_the_faith_desc: "The way Buddhism currently is in Tibetan land is not going to stay the same forever since, over the coming decades, we will gain new people and followers who bring new perspectives on old texts, mantras, and traditions that we already know so well. What then do we do and say to these new insights? We welcome them, of course! We will bring them into the wider inter-faith dialogue and be ready to reform our understanding of canonical texts, but it will take time for this to happen."
 converse_with_indian_buddhists: "Conferences and Conversations"
 converse_with_indian_buddhists_desc: "We are not going to be closed off to the other branches of Buddhism that are spread throughout the various lands around Tibet. The traditions of the Indian people, the traditions of the Chinese, the traditions of the Burmese and Thai, they can all contribute to the wider dialogue and conversation we of Guge wish to have, but we simply need more people ready and willing to travel these long distances. Perhaps setting up a formal diplomatic sector is in order?"
 cultural_blending_in_guge: "All Under the Guidance of Guge"
 cultural_blending_in_guge_desc: "Guge has proven itself to be a guiding pillar of Buddhism before when all was thought to be lost in Tibetan lands; when Buddhism seemed to be fragmented to the point of no return. With the resurgance of the grand faith thanks to our hard work and reforms, we can now work on assimilating the various people who are coming into the fold of Guge so that they too can come toward the path of enlightenment. We cannot and will not deny anybody this right in Guge."

We are not averse to fighting like some smaller polities are, for we have been in the midst of fighting for decades now! Fighting to secure our place in Tibet and fighting to have our words become law!"
 uphold_the_shamarpa_hierarch: "Uphold the Karma Kagyu School"
 uphold_the_shamarpa_hierarch_desc: "We are not patrons of the Gelug school of Vajrayana Buddhism which some find strange. Instead, we support the Karma Kagyu school which is quite different in a number of ways when compared to the Gelug school. Its traditional hierarchs, the Karmapa and Shamarpa, should be great friends of our dynasty instead of having to quarrel with other religious schools; they will know our good will and will be one of the strategic pillars of our rise to power."
 sort_through_muddy_marriages: "Profit from Bad Marriages"
 sort_through_muddy_marriages_desc: "Marriages can be a... Tough negotiation for some, to put it nicely, and this is very widely pronounced in the royal families of Tibet since a failing marriage or two in a royal family can lead to widespread discontent in places far away from the royal palace. We were ones to capitalize on marriage conflicts in the previous royal family of Tibet, the Phagmodrupa, and we will continue to profit from future bad marriages around us whilst make sure our own marriages are safe and without issue."

 at_the_heart_of_turmoil_desc: "There is no shortage of warfare in the heartlands of Tibet. Local lords wanting autonomy, Nepali states struggling against Hindu and Islamic states to the south, Muslim khans to the north threatening our survival, nothing is ever easy up here! If continued war is required to survive in our own land than we will take up arms without hesitation!"
 keep_the_sects_loyal: "Keeping the Sects Loyal"
 keep_the_sects_loyal_desc: "The Rinpungpa dynasty must not lose the favor of the Karma Kagyu school of Buddhism nor the other sects of Tibetan Buddhism that have sent aid in the past. We should be enforcing more secular authority over these sects when possible, or if this is not possible, then at least be informed about the moves these sects are making so that we can effectively counter them politically or religiously when the time comes."
 put_pretenders_to_rest: "Confront Pretenders"
 put_pretenders_to_rest_desc: "Some still see us as pretenders to the throne and think that the Phagmodrupa dynasty should be empowered once again, but we simply cannot let this happen. The Rinpungpa dynasty is in a much better place than the Phagmodrupa dynasty ever was, and if there are any pretenders who wish to install this old dynasty back on the throne, we will gladly meet them in battle or silence them before they can even raise a war banner."
 break_down_autonomous_tibetans: "Refuse Local Lords"
 break_down_autonomous_tibetans_desc: "The loyalty of local lords is always questionable in Tibet, is it not? Few if any can be truly honest if they are selected by members outside of our administration, meaning we are going to need to overhaul the way we govern as time goes on to better enforce laws that come directly from the Rinpungpa dynasty. Autonomous lords and authorities that answered to previous people we conquered will be granted no quarter; they will be replaced."

The monastery has stripes of white, dark red, and gray colors that are unique to the Sakya school of Tibetan Buddhism, and itt is through this monastery that we will project our legitimacy and devotion to all the people of Kham."
 monastery_and_works_of_thang_tong_gyalpo: "Material Works of the Iron Bridge Maker"
 monastery_and_works_of_thang_tong_gyalpo_desc: "The great Thangtong Gyalpo graced many with his presence and works, including us who administrate Kham. He built our revered Gonchen Monastery and also was an adept architect, blacksmith, and civil engineer, making his impact known in the various lands of Tibet and Bhutan. Not only this, but he also considered the patron saint of theatre in our lands and he is known as 'the madman of the empty land'. Truly his impact on our land and history is unparalleled."
 spiritual_works_of_thang_tong_gyalpo: "Spiritual Works of the Iron Bridge Maker"
 spiritual_works_of_thang_tong_gyalpo_desc: "The works of Thangtong Gyalpo were not only in the physical realm though! His work extended far into the realm of Tibetan Buddhism since he is associated with the Shangpa Kagyu, Nyingma, and Sakya schools. Not only this, but he also recognized the first Samding Dorja Phagmo, the highest female incarnation in Tibet and the third highest-ranking persion in the hierarchy after the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama. On top of all of this, he founded the Iron Chain leneage of the Shangpa Kagyu school, thus furthering his work and influence. Truly, Thangtong is a reincarnation of Dolpopa Sherab Gyaltsen."
 uphold_dege: "Upholding Dege"
 uphold_dege_desc: "Dege, as our capital city, should be upheld in the highest regard next to the various monasteries and sacred sites we possess. It should be built up to not only project our prominence, but also to attract foreign scholars and religious folk who also wish to come toward the path of Buddhism. As Kham continues to grow outward, so too will our capital city."
 uphold_tibetan_literature: "Tibetan Literature"
 uphold_tibetan_literature_desc: "Literature in Tibetan lands can be somewhat scarce and lacking due to a variety of reasons, but as time goes on, the potential for this to change is becoming more and more abundant to us. By putting through reforms to start paper production and to educate the minds of younger and younger people, we can begin to cultivate a strong literary culture throughout Kham."
 formalize_derge_districts: "Formalize the Districts"
 formalize_derge_districts_desc: "City organization in Tibet hasn't been the highest priority to many leaders both local and royal, but routinely we are seeing the need to plan our cities out more and more as time goes on. Starting with Dege, we should work to plan out our new districts in various cities with engineers and workers alike so that buildings are as functional as possible and also robust in their construction."

 chinese_contacts_desc: "To our east is the Sichuan Basin, a great trading hub for Tibetans and Chinese people alike. Chengdu may be ethnically Chinese, but we are thankful that it has blossomed into a grand city of trade and production since the path from Chengdu to Dege is fairly clear to many. Contacts with our eastern neighbors will only continue to serve us well later on as trade grows ever more plentiful."

 after_the_yuan_dynasty_desc: "After the decline of the Yuan Dynasty to our east, the authority in Tibet that the Mongols once had waned heavily and we were one of the bastions of Tibetan strength. Our dynasty created an autonomous Tibetan state and formally threw off the shackles of Mongol authority and it is because of this that many still flock to our banners."

 regents_for_the_old_kings_desc: "Our early rulers did not strive for earthly titles that gave meaningless honor, for they knew that they were regents for the old kings of Tibet. The glory of those olden days may not be coming back any time soon, but we can still strive to be humble like our first set of rulers and live as they did, for the Tibetan people and by Tibetan laws."
 fortified_city_governance: "Dzong Governance"
 fortified_city_governance_desc: "To help organize our political situation, forming a solid basis for authority beneath us was crucial in our upbringing. The creation of dzongs (fortified cities meant for local governance) helped cement our authority on the local level and did a great amount of work in projecting our power throughout Tibet when we were much larger in size."
 tibetan_laws_for_our_land: "Staunchly Tibetan Laws"
 tibetan_laws_for_our_land_desc: "No longer are we ruled by Mongolian laws, but rather by Tibetan laws! Those foreign edicts and measures put on our people in the past were undoubtedly burdensome, but now since we've been independent, we have been able to implement laws meant for our own people. No longer will we bear the weight of the old Mongol authorities."
 neutral_relations_on_the_outside: "Neutral Relations are Good Relations"
 neutral_relations_on_the_outside_desc: "When the Ming Dynasty rose up in the place of the Yuan Dynasty, it was clear that they did not think much of us in Tibet. These fairly neutral relations were and still are beneficial to us, since we can thrive whilst being left alone and not pressured diplomatically from various sides."
 three_functional_parts_of_the_dynasty: "Three Parts to the Dynasty"
 three_functional_parts_of_the_dynasty_desc: "The Phagmodrupa dynasty is divided up into three parts: the ruling 'desi', the spiritual masters (chen-nga), and the preserver of the family (dunggyu dsinpa). This helps ensure not only the piety of our lineage, but also the continuation of far into the future... But, it can also lead to a number of internal feuds if we are not careful."

 the_fire_of_feuds_desc: "Failed marriages and corruption are not strangers to the Phagmodrupa dynasty, not since the Rinpungpa dynasty has risen up and taken advantage of our vulnerable position in the past. We need to learn how to sort out our internal conflicts in the future so that we can prevent future disturbances and revolts, and most of all, we will exact revenge upon the Rinpungpa dynasty."

Some of these old road networks and paths we can still use, and Cajamarca's foundation will be built off of moving quickly thanks to these old paths between villages and towns."

 beacon_of_culture_desc: "Cajamarca is perhaps the most complex and grand political state that emerged after the collapse of the Wari Empire. Though we are not on the level of the Wari Empire in terms of size or strength, we still have some of the finest pottery and works of art in all of the mountainous land. Surely over time we will attract the likes of various scholars and religious people alike who will serve in Cajamarca."

 experiences_from_civil_wars_desc: "In our past, civil conflict was something that we could not avoid. Even today, civil war looms on the horizon and threatens our people with devasation if politics in Cajamarca decline horribly. But, there is one thing that these wretched conflicts breed in our soldiers: experience. How to prepare for battle and get supply lines ready, these are things they'll never forget thanks to our previous eras of internal strife."

 from_oral_tradition_to_written_desc: "Oral tradition is a great thing for Cajamarca and indeed many of the surrounding people groups we interact with, but oral history is something we cannot rely on forever. We should begin a new effort to formally begin making a writing system for our people so that the oral history of our ancestors may never be truly lost, even when our current elders pass away."

 start_roads_of_cajamarca_desc: "Old Wari paths are just the perfect places for future road networks. The innovations in road making done by those in Cusco are spreading quickly and we of Cajamarca would be wise to adopt them, utilizing their fine designs for ourselves and having our military officers trained in exactly how the should operate."

 fighting_the_quito_desc: "The northern area where the Quito people live is a place of consistent conflict. Though some chiefs and rulers have made peace with us before, more often than not our interests are in conflict with each other. In order to fully subjugate the Quito people and perhaps any others who would wish to go against our interests, we will need a larger standing military."

It is a faded memory, but one that is distinct and unique to us as Yellow Uyghurs or, Yugurs as sometimes we are called. This period was prosperous for us indeed, but also a time of intense warfare between us and various other people since we occupied a very valuable position. It is this tradition of warfare that we still remember to this day."

 our_trade_is_warfare_desc: "Even when we held the position as a mighty kingdom, war was still part of our life, year by year and decade by decade. After our destruction and period of subjugation by the Tanguts and later by the Western Xia and then the Mongols, we remember just how integral war has been for us. Conquest is the only path for us in the future, and there will be no satiating this ambition within the Yugur people."

 the_influences_of_buddhism_desc: "Buddhism has come into the lands of the Uyghurs due to being so close to Tibet and the Chinese people, though the latter practice Confucianism along with Buddhism. We are not opposed to Buddhism and its influences since its teaching can often go hand-in-hand with the traditions of Tengri. Perhaps in time we can even learn to become somewhat tolerant of foreign faiths that don't line up with with the traditions of Tengri, but that is for later."
 learn_from_tangut_dominance: "Tales of the Tangut Period"
 learn_from_tangut_dominance_desc: "The destruction of our old kingdom led into a period where we were dominated by the Tanguts. It was a dark time where we were forced from a place of grace into a place of relative uncertainty and subjugation. It is something we will never forget and something we will fight to never let happen to us again."
 the_western_xia_war: "The Western Xia War"
 the_western_xia_war_desc: "In the times of our old kingdom, the Western Xia made war against us and inflicted costly casualties to our people and helped weaken us for more foreign foes later on. Learning from this costly war has led to our best commanders and officers thinking that we should be investing in a larger and more structure military instead of trying to focus on pure diplomacy to prevent such a destructive war in the future."

 the_carnage_of_oirat_ming_wars_desc: "Between the fighting that goes on between the Oirat Horde and the Ming Dynasty, we are stuck almost in the middle of it all wondering who will come out on top. If we are ambitious enough, we can capitalize on the destruction of the losing side and make valuable gains for all of Kara Del, but we will have to be strategic about when and where we strike. The traditions of our ancestors in the steppe necessitate that conquest be key to our survival, and this is the perfect playground for us to do as such."
 descendants_of_the_chagatai: "Descendants of the Chagatai Khanate"
 descendants_of_the_chagatai_desc: "Our origins lie in the thoughts and actions of a Chagatai prince in the past and to some, it is a menial origin story that has little meaning. To us though, it grants us valuable connections dynastically to the Chagatai Khanate that came after the split of the old Mongol Empire. Maintaining our dyanstic presence will ensure loyalty and legitimacy in the people we will over."
 playing_the_role_of_subject: "The Benefits of Subjugation"
 playing_the_role_of_subject_desc: "We have been subjects of larger powers in the past since Kara Del has historically been a weak power. This has its consequences of paying tribute and such, but we have benefited via taking into account the better technology and organization that our overlords had. Taking advantage of the advances our neighbors have and implementing reforms in their style, well, why wouldn't we continue to do it?"

 an_oasis_of_opportunities_desc: "Being where we are, it is a precarious set of circumstances. Several prominent states and people want our land because of how valuable it is for trade and military operations, but we are not going to just stand by and let them subjugated us. We are instead going to utilize our position in such a valuable area to increase our own revenue, capitalize on foreign contacts, and even try to become more self sustaining in the face of increasing foreign tension."

#to_what_deity_do_we_praise_desc: "We find ourselves at the confluence of several faiths: Tengri and its traditions, Islam and its five pillars, and Buddhism and its schools of thought. It is not easy choosing one religion over the other as Kara Del has populations of all three in its land, but we can at least try to make do in tolerating all three whenever possible. Promoting a stance of tolerance will undoubtedly lend to a greater amount of people flocking to our stable banner."
 mercenaries_from_the_oirat: "Contracts in the Steppe"
 mercenaries_from_the_oirat_desc: "Our connections to the Chagatai Khanate lends us connections all around the steppe which is good since there are a variety of mercenary forces that will be more in favor of working for an influential descendant of the Chagatai. Hiring these largely cavalry-based armies will cost us, but we know that they will be worth it later on since they can act as a good buffer for our own forces."

Cavalry armies are something that we know inside and out, and focusing on reforming how they work in battle is going to be one of our main focuses in the future.

The more we formalize it though, the more useful it will become and the more standardized it can be from place to place in our own lands, thus granting easier communication to all people in our domain."

 northern_influences_in_calchaqui_desc: "To our north are other states that quarrel in the mountains due to various feuds and conflicts, but we do not seek to get involved with those petty situations. We are seeing more and more people come south due to those struggles, however, and as a result we are becoming slowly influences by our northern neighbors.

Though we speak the same language, they don't feel as closely connected to us unfortunately due to the years we have spent trying to consolidate our own power and maintain stability. If we can reach out to these groups and befriend them over time, we can slowly integrate them into the Calchaqui confederation as it stands."

 reprisals_against_invaders_desc: "As we slowly unite the various Cacan speaking groups of people around us, we must instill in them a staunch defensive mentality against those who would invade our lands. There are some who think the lands of the Calchaqui can be just pillaged and settled by other populations, but we will bring to them a stalwart defense that will grind down their will to fight. The Cacan speaking people will not be taken out so easily."

 cultivate_a_proper_confederation_desc: "Centralizing authority in our lands is something we struggle with since people are so spread out and our work at formalizing our language is still going on, but making loyal that contribute to the Calchaqui cause nicely is much easier to do. Perhaps a federated state is not our true path, but instead a more confederated state is what will make us truly great."

Their culture and tradtiions might very well be alien to us, but we are not beyond learning to accept them into our fold; our shyris and those around him know the value of accepting these people as they are."

 quitu_cara_cultural_power_desc: "Quito is not a political entity with a single 'Quito' culture that extends back for many centuries. Instead, the original Quitu people were conquered some centuries ago by people of the Cara culture, but the conquest did not bring about great death and destruction as one might think. Instead, it brought about a combining of cultures into a product that is greater than its previous individual parts. This Quitu-Cara culture that sprang forth is what we are today and it is what we draw power from in our administration and in our military."

 trade_with_various_tribes_desc: "Just as we meet and try to integrate the tribes around us, we should be keen on trading with them as well. They hold connections to places far beyond our current reach, meaning we could greatly benefit from promoting trade with them over time. Even when we integrate them inside of our borders, maintaining healthy relationships with the tribal people will be key to keeping the economy of Quito running smoothly."
 integrate_the_others_into_quito: "Integrate Other Cultures"
 integrate_the_others_into_quito_desc: "Over time, we are learning to accept and work with people who speak different languages and perform different rituals. Some words blend together over the decades and centuries, some rituals become closer together in how they are performed, and eventually the bond of common kinship is formed as these people join hands with our own. It is these joined hands and through bonds of kinship built up over many ages that Quito will maintain its power both politically and militarily."
 celebrate_our_lives: "Celebrate Life"
 celebrate_our_lives_desc: "Though we may give our people a grand way of being sent off into the next life, we must also take time to celebrate our own life as it is, right? Feasts filled with joy and praise to the gods above, games being played by children and adults, instruments being played by our own family members, and good times being had by all within our communities. These are the times we should relish and adore, not just the times of victory via conquest or the success of a good harvest."
 ZAF_ideas: "Massina Ideas"
 ZAF_ideas_start: "Massina Traditions"
 ZAF_ideas_bonus: "Massina Ambition"
 part_of_the_muslim_uprisings: "The Fulani Jihad!"
 part_of_the_muslim_uprisings_desc: "For far too long there have been kafirs and infidels taking power against Islamic emirs and sheiks, but no more! Massina will be one of the many spearheads of the jihad started by Fulani people and there will be Islamic justice for all those who used their power to stifle Islam's spread! To arms, brothers and sisters, to arms!"
 madrasas_of_massina: "Islamic Learning of Massina"
 madrasas_of_massina_desc: "Though Massina is new to the land it sits upon, Islam is not new and as such certain ideas about Islam are already spread heavily in certain cities of ours. Let us help promote Islam's spread by building up madrasas throughout the land so that not only can ideas be propagated over time, but also things such as literacy and mathematics can be utilized by a wider portion of the populace."
 strict_islamic_interpretation: "The Strictness of Islam"
 strict_islamic_interpretation_desc: "There can be no room for a loose interpretation of Islam in Massina; there must be exact wording in our laws and strict adherence to what is outlined throughout the Quran and the Hadiths. Through our interpretation of Islam we will have a tighter grip on power and few will be able to question our authority without also raising questions about their own piety."
 regulated_use_niger_river_land: "Regulate Land Usage"
 regulated_use_niger_river_land_desc: "As part of our laws we firmly regulate the usage of land along the Niger River. This has resulted in a great rise in productive potential since people can use the land in a proper and organized manner instead of roaming about without clear boundaries. In time, we will see our profits increase when trade along the Niger River comes through to Massina."
 the_guards_of_hamdullahi: "The Guards of Hamdullahi"
 the_guards_of_hamdullahi_desc: "Hamdullahi is a significant city in Massina as it holds a great deal of cultural history to us. The guards of Hamdullahi, though undoubtedly changed at this point since their inception, still stand as a monument to our past and should be remembered for their stalwart attitude in defending Hamdullahi against invading forces. If we can instill this defensive mentality in more people, our defensive capabilities will be much better."
 strengthen_laws_of_land_development: "Strengthen Land Development"
 strengthen_laws_of_land_development_desc: "Through our laws on land development, more and more people are coming to our cities and communities to settle down and begin a new life of agriculture instead of living a pastoral and nomadic life. This has granted us advantages over time and allowed us to start developing our urban centers even further than before which we will certainly need to do as times continue to change around Massina."
 open_up_to_islamic_dialogue: "The Seeds of Religious Dialogue"
 open_up_to_islamic_dialogue_desc: "And as our urban centers grow, we will be attracting new religious scholars and preachers who interpret Islamic doctrine differently than we do. Instead of turning them away and persecuting all those who think differently from us, we can perhaps have some religious dialogue over time and open up specific centers of religious study so that we can refine our own interpretation of Islam alongside others."
 SOF_ideas: "Bamana Ideas"
 SOF_ideas_start: "Bamana Traditions"
 SOF_ideas_bonus: "Bamana Ambition"
 patrol_the_niger_river: "Patrol the Niger River"
 patrol_the_niger_river_desc: "The blood of an empire can be trade revenue, and for the Bamana state, trade along the Niger River is proving to be almost like blood for us. We must always be striving to make sure it is safe and secure so that not only can we profit from trade canoes going along its flowing streams, but so that we can profit from producing valuable crops alongside the banks of the river itself."
 subjugate_rival_chiefs: "Subjugate Internal Pretenders"
 subjugate_rival_chiefs_desc: "The pretenders to our throne and the ones who would see our power broken up are always on the lookout for weak spots in our state. We must have an active and capable military force that is ready to cut down insurgents whenever and wherever they rise up and, if it is even possible, before they rise up."
 the_komo_council: "The Komo Council"
 the_komo_council_desc: "The administration of Bamana is traditional in many ways. Our ancestors are revered all across our land throughout our court system and the komo, a body of advisors dedicated solely to theological matters, helps us conduct our worship to our ancestors correctly. Let us hope and pray for a better future that all of Bamana can partake in."
 the_slave_war_cycle: "The Slave-War Cycle"
 the_slave_war_cycle_desc: "Slaves and wars are consistent throughout West Africa and we are no different in relying on the continual slave-war cycle. Part of our economy and military rely on the capturing and trading around of slaves so it is only right that we become adept at manipulating this cycle to our advantage. The more calculated our war efforts are and if we can deal with slaves on a consistent basis, we'll see the populace become used to this cycle as well as the state itself."
 build_up_segu_cities: "Build up Bamana Cities"
 build_up_segu_cities_desc: "Our cities grow more and more as we continue to move on in the world, but how should we go about improving them over time? City planning is, after all, a key feature of a well-defined state and we of course are striving to be just that. Perhaps investing in Bamana architecture and engineering and promoting slave work for these endeavors would help bring a semblance of city planning to our land."
 sculptures_and_altars_to_our_ancestors: "To Our Ancestors"
 sculptures_and_altars_to_our_ancestors_desc: "The sculptures and altars we fashion for our long gone ancestors are finely made and well thought out. They have meaning in almost every detail and our administration rightly places a great emphasis on them being part of the centrality of our state since they represent such significant figures of our past. Promoting the fine crafting of these works of art and faithfulness should be something we always strive to do."
 improve_upon_songhai_build_methods: "Improve Building Methods"
 improve_upon_songhai_build_methods_desc: "The methods of building we obtained from the Songhai are more for building defensive structures and they have served us well so far. Continuing to develop these methods of constructing walls, garrisons, and defensive structures from the materials we have around us will help improve our defensive positions and provide more security to our people."
 YAO_ideas: "Yao Ideas"
 YAO_ideas_start: "Yao Traditions"
 YAO_ideas_bonus: "Yao Ambition"
 fusion_of_kayi_and_ngizimis_clan: "Fusion of Two Clans"
 fusion_of_kayi_and_ngizimis_clan_desc: "The inception of Yao came as a result of our nomadic ancestors coming into prolonged contact with Kanem Bornu's people. After this, a slow fusion of two clans happened, this being between the Kayi Clan and Ngizimis Kanembu Clan, and the result was the political entity of Yao. Tracing our heritage back to this pivotal period is what our people look up to time and time again, and we will always trace our lineage to back to that period."
 rivalry_versus_kanem: "The Lake Chad Rivalry"
 rivalry_versus_kanem_desc: "Lake Chad is fertile ground for food and growing states, but it is also fertile ground for conflict between Kanem Bornu and ourselves, the Sultanate of Yao. We've had ages of conflict before and we will continue to in the future if we neither of us win this prolonged state of hostility that has lasted for generations."
 facing_deathly_counter_attacks: "Facing Death Again"
 facing_deathly_counter_attacks_desc: "Though we once had the upper hand against Kanem Bornu in the late 1300s, those 5 leaders we killed in Kanem Bornu did not break down the power of our enemy completely. They came back and struck a blow against us so hard it almost made the entirety of Yao collapse in on itself, but we managed to hold ourselves firm despite this devasation. That moment in time taught our people that facing death in a war is something that will be frequent for Yao, and we will still fight with all we got no matter how close to death we are."
 caravans_toward_egypt: "Caravans Toward Egypt"
 caravans_toward_egypt_desc: "Because of our position in the eastern part of Lake Chat and toward the treacherous desert, and also because of our nomadic heritage from before we settled down, we have trade contacts throughout the eastern land and even toward the Nile River. The more trade we promote eastward toward the Nile River and ultimately toward Egypt, the better off we will be in terms of revenue."
 lake_chads_importance: "The Centrality of the Lake"
 lake_chads_importance_desc: "The lake by which we base our power around is significant to many people. The fertility it provides for crops and the fact that it is also a freshwater lake means that it can support a great amount of people and a great state surrounding it. The more finely we cultivate the land here, the more we will have in store for later on."
 nomadic_warfare_ways: "The Ways of the Nomads"
 nomadic_warfare_ways_desc: "Fighting as nomadic people is something few can master, especially when the fighting is along sand dunes and sparse savannah. Though we aren't nomads anymore, the leaders of Yao are versed in nomadic warfare and moving quickly around the field of war so that the enemy has little chance of catching a friendly army out in the open."
 season_of_bilala_conquest: "Season of Conquest"
 season_of_bilala_conquest_desc: "Once our conquest of around the lake is complete and the old traditions of the Kanem Bornu state are incorporated into the Sultanate of Yao, we will begin carving a new path for ourselves and the people around Lake Chad; we will be feared by others, instead of being subjugated by rival empires and kingdoms. There is no time to rest now, not when its the season of conquest for the Bilala people!"
 KOK_ideas: "Kokand Ideas"
 KOK_ideas_start: "Kokand Traditions"
 KOK_ideas_bonus: "Kokand Ambition"
 citadel_of_kokand: "The Citadel of Kokand"
 citadel_of_kokand_desc: "Kokand itself has been our starting point and the place from which we project power from. Though it was not so grand at its start, we have worked hard to build up its defensive structures so that raids and attacks against us would yield little results. Even though we rely heavily on old khanate traditions, there is some wisdom in keeping certain positions locked down and heavily fortified."
 tajik_mercenary_fighters: "Tajik Mercenaries"
 tajik_mercenary_fighters_desc: "Mercenaries around us are plentiful and always willing to fight if we have the money to spend, and in particular the Tajik people are usually offering Uzbek states and khanates lower prices than other states due to our familial connections. Taking advantage of these blood ties can be advantageous for us when we are in a tight spot and in the future we can expand the connections we have to other mercenary groups around the steppe."
 swift_conquest_around_the_oxus: "In and Around the Oxus River"
 swift_conquest_around_the_oxus_desc: "The Oxus River has been stage for a number of states that came before us and it has seen countless conquests from a variety of people. We are going to continue this tradition and conquer land just like our ancestors have, leaving fire and blood behind us as our people march forth, banner in one hand and musket in the other."
 the_khojas_of_kashgar: "The Kashgar Khojas"
 the_khojas_of_kashgar_desc: "Khojas (meaning 'master' in Persian) are people who are descedants of the Naqshabandi Sufi teacher named Amad Kasani (1461-1542). At various points they have seen rises in power throughout Central Asia since they have been favored local and regional administrators. Perhaps we could use their service too and appoint various khojas to positions of authority in Kokand... After ensuring that they are loyal to us, of course."
 preventing_civil_wars: "Prevent Collapses"
 preventing_civil_wars_desc: "Like most other khanates we too are prone to collapse from internal strife and succession crises. Reforming laws of succession are tough as it is, but Kokand is in need of strong central authority that has an administrative body built around it, not just a lone holder of power that rules through blood and iron. If Kokand is to survive into the future, there will need to be hefty changes to our old traditions."
 unify_the_uzbek_people: "Uzbek Unity"
 unify_the_uzbek_people_desc: "Our kin that lie around the Aral Sea and west of the Tarim Basin, the Uzbek people, are rather disunited and longing for leadership that can tame their various clans. Whilst Kokand is by no means the first contender in this matter, it can strive to be the final unifying state that comes out on top and unites all of the Uzbek people into a solidified state. Doing so would bring not only unparalleled prosperity, but also a great sense of joy to the various Uzbek people."
 a_settled_khanate: "Changing Times, Changing People"
 a_settled_khanate_desc: "We cannot deny that our traditions of khans and steppe riders are becoming outdated more and more. To our south in the lands of Persia, we see sprawling cities such as Herat and Samarkand that thrive off trade and production from hard working and settled citizens; to our north and east, the endless steppe yields the same things century after century with very little change. Perhaps it is time we strike the earth and plant our banner in it once and for all, settling our people down slowly and founding new cities for the entirety of Kokand."
 colla_kingdoms_ideas: "Aymara Kingdom Ideas"
 colla_kingdoms_ideas_start: "Aymara Kingdom Traditions"
 colla_kingdoms_ideas_desc: "Aymara Kingdom Ambition"
 dualistic_governing_body: "Dualistic Governing Body"
 dualistic_governing_body_desc: "Much like other polities in the mountains we come from, our governing body is dualistic in its nature with both parts working together to govern the land in harmony but also recognizing that one side is superior to the other. Over time, we can reform this tradition into a more centralized version that still keeps true to what our ancestors set up in past ages."
 sacred_shrine_of_lake_titikaka: "Lake Titikaka Shrine"
 sacred_shrine_of_lake_titikaka_desc: "The shrine at Lake Titikaka is inhabited by our people and is held sacred by many people groups throughout the mountains and hills around us. Keeping its sanctity and keeping the land around the lake safe will help bring more faithful followers to our state."
 the_three_colla_people_groups: "Colla, Puquina, and Uro"
 the_three_colla_people_groups_desc: "The three main groups of people that make up the various cities and dominions of the Aymara people are the Colla, the Puquina, and the Uro. All three hold various amounts of power depending on what city you travel to and gaining the loyalty of all three is a must if we are to have a decent sized fighting force."
 contesting_the_mountain_territories: "Contest for the Mountains"
 contesting_the_mountain_territories_desc: "The mountains breed warfare unlike any other place around us since, even though the terrain might be rough and air might be thin, the will of the lords and kings to fight for power never ceases despite what happens. As we go forth, our people will become addept in mountain tactics and movements in and around hills to the point that we will be able to outdo any enemy that stands in our way."
 bring_up_urcosuyu_and_umasuyu: "Urcosuyu and Umasuyu"
 bring_up_urcosuyu_and_umasuyu_desc: "The two regions of Urcosuyu and Umasuyu are more so administrative divisions for us and are the basis by which we are reforming our laws of the land. By establishing these regions more firmly with inheritance laws and stronger local authorities, we will be able to develop the lands more more easily."
 earth_work_defenses: "Earthen Defenses"
 earth_work_defenses_desc: "Much like other people groups around us, the defenses of our land are made of earthen materials like stone and mud bricks. We can improve on this though, and work on how our fortifications are built from the ground up and in what ways they supported via supply routes and internal garrison structures."
 successor_to_tiwanaku: "Succeed Tiwanaku"
 successor_to_tiwanaku_desc: "The old polity of Tiwanaku that came before us, its memory has faded a great deal by now. Still, some traditions and tales live on from those olden times when Tiwanaku was around and in large part we are the only embodiment of a successor to Tiwanaku. If it falls to only us being around to succeed where they left off, then let us do so."
 NUP_ideas: "Nupe Ideas"
 NUP_ideas_start: "Nupe Traditions"
 NUP_ideas_bonus: "Nupe Ambition"
 times_of_rare_unification: "Rarely Unified"
 times_of_rare_unification_desc: "It seems like we are scattered and disunited throughout the ages and surrounding people groups take advantage of us whenever they can, but is there any hope of claiming unity amongst the Nupe people? Glimmers of light have shown this in the past, but still we remember the fighting and feuds that always brought down these hopes. Let us never forget the times of warfare before we were unified into our current state."
 etsu_nupe: "Etsu Nupe"
 etsu_nupe_desc: "The Etsu Nupe, or, King of the Nupe, is a title that has been claimed before and is claimed now, sure, but there must be solid backing behind it. We are consistently working on building up our base of power in terms of military potential, but at the same time we are working to solve age-old disputes our leader and his lineage may have with other Nupe clans and tribes."
 traditional_customs_with_islam: "To Share in Faith"
 traditional_customs_with_islam_desc: "We share many religious customs with several people groups around us, but this new faith called 'Islam' is increasingly coming forth to Nupe communities and their preachers seem intent on converting us. Whilst we will resist full conversion of this suspicious new religion, some of our friends and allies have taken up Islam and been completely fine with it; perhaps we could see what this faith has to offer us."
 the_nupe_hero_tsoede: "The Legacy of Tsoede"
 the_nupe_hero_tsoede_desc: "If there is one figure in Nupe history that we look up to, it is Tsoede, the great unifier of Nupe people. Him and his men unified the 12 villages (Tafie, Bida, Doko, Esa, Nupeko, Eda, Towagi, Egbe, Ewu, Yesa, Gaba, and Panjuru) into a single loose political entity and helped assimilate people who crossed over into Nupe territory. We will learn from his example and keep his memory alive through stories and art as we go forth into the future."
 assimilate_the_border_people: "Taking in the Border People"
 assimilate_the_border_people_desc: "There are a variety of people on our border as the border itself is not concrete; it is porous and can be freely passed through at times by a variety of people. Thus, we find a great number of settlements at our borders and these people do not speak our language or share many Nupe cultural traits. Perhaps bringing our traditions and culture to them will help cement their fealty and loyalty to us and bring them closer to being true Nupe people."
 power_through_marriages_and_kinship: "The Power of Kin"
 power_through_marriages_and_kinship_desc: "Bringing together two different sides through the act of marriage is at times a great way to ease tensions and we of Nupe are keen on making sure these marriages go smoothly. Whether they are internal families who have feuds with us or foreign families who are potential allies, securing valuable marriages with a variety of people will spread the influence of the Nupe far and wide."
 fight_back_against_islamic_conquest: "Clashes against Islam"
 fight_back_against_islamic_conquest_desc: "Islam may have its good parts and may be somewhat present in Nupe lands, but there are political entities that take Islam to the worst degree possible and wage war against us in the name of it. We will not stand by and watch our fields burn and men die in vain, no, we will rally against these unjust wars and fight back with all that we can."

 spa_influences_of_catholicism: "Catholic Roots"
 spa_influences_of_catholicism_desc: "Catholicism in Iberia, there almost nothing that is quite as natural as this, and with the fires of the Protestant Reformation making Europe a pool of different forms of Christianity that turn away from the one true faith, Iberia is perhaps the only bastion of righteous Catholicism left. This will not break our spirit, but rather it will embolden us to do more in the name of Christ and the Holy See!"
 spa_high_seas_fleet: "Armada of the Spanish"
 spa_high_seas_fleet_desc: "Iberia has had to deal with coastal raids and threats form the sea for centuries and it has taught the various people of the peninsula to build up what naval forces they can to combat foreigners intruding on their land. Whether they be Portuguese sailors, Castilian admirals, Aragonese builders, or even Galician cartographers, we will ensure that every single part of our future armada will be specifically built to uphold the coastal integrity of Spain."
 spa_strong_colonial_authority: "The Watchful Eyes of Spain"
 spa_strong_colonial_authority_desc: "Our subjects, be they viceroys, small dukes, or local governors, know that the Spanish crown is always keen on hearing them out for what they need and what they have to say. Listening to what our subjects need is crucial to keeping them loyal, but we must also watch their every action that we possibly can should a corrupt subject attempt to collude with the enemies of Spain. There will be none who evade our watchful eyes."
 spa_tercio_reformation: "Reformation of the Tercios"
 spa_tercio_reformation_desc: "The tercios of old were innovative when they were first introduced, but as time has gone on there have been innovations in various fields that have allowed foreign infantry and cavalry to take out our tercios. Reformation is needed on the surface of things, and not only this but new tactics revolving around new technology must be integrated with our tercios if Spain is every going to be a true and proper military power."
 por_feitorias: "Promote Feitorias"
 por_feitorias_desc: "From our formative days as Portugal to where we are now as Spain, the feitorias around the world for us have been nothing but grand for goal of making more money through trade. Increasing the amount built and perhaps even converting a few into actual Spanish trading colonies could yield untold amounts of benefits for us as well."
 por_marines: "Spanish Marines"
 por_marines_desc: "The days as Portugal taught out soldiers that attacking coastal settlements from ships is something that takes time and training to master. Being a marine in the Spanish military is nothing short of an honor as it signifies that they are truly ready to be on the front of Spain's wars and colonies, fighting from coast to coast in order to secure what is rightfully ours."
 por_trade_monopolies: "Monopolized"
 por_trade_monopolies_Desc: "There is only one power that can make more money from trade than we can and that power is Venice, but they are locked into the Mediterranean Sea whilst we of Spain are free to take our interests beyond the shores of the inland sea. We will monopolize what markets we can in the world and ensure that Spanish trade interests satisfied by our merchants."
 cas_the_inquisition: "The Spanish Inquisition!"
 cas_the_inquisition_desc: "Whether through promises of salvation, sending a few spare coins their way, or making them feel the pain that Christ felt when he was on the cross, the Spanish Inquisition will work to enforce the Catholic faith throughout Spain and its holdings. Nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition to come forth and bring unity to the masses, but they will indeed do this through the power of righteous faith and sanctioned methods."
 cas_reformation_of_cabildos: "Reformation of the Cabildos"
 cas_reformation_of_cabildos_desc: "Though the cabildo may be used to help represent the various land owners in a certain province, it is routinely vulnerable to corruption via the people running it since they are more or less governors of an entire area away from central Spanish authority. We must work to reform the cabildos into a stronger institution that can represent the various Spanish people properly and without colored glasses shaping what we see beneath the cabildo."
 cas_far_reaching_spanish_people: "Every Continent, a Spanish Flag"
 cas_far_reaching_spanish_people_desc: "Some would say that the Spanish people are spilling into whatever land they can for the sake of spreading out, but this is a simplistic way of seeing our endeavors. In reality, we strive to influence what politics we can in the favor of Spanish interests, and part of doing that means colonizing lands all across the world with strong Spanish communities."
 ara_mercenary_princes: "Princely Mercenaries"
 ara_mercenary_princes_desc: "Aragonese roots bring with them a plethora of mercenary connections as our past princes have been made to lead various mercenary companies both in and out of Iberia. Though we are steadily cutting down on how many mercenaries we use, these ties to various mercenary companies could indeed be useful for us in the future if Spain is in a tight spot."
 ara_charter_companies: "Charter Companies of Spain"
 ara_charter_companies_desc: "Why must we colonize everything with valuable Spanish families when we can instead cultivate our interests through charter companies that are supported by our military at times? Surely this method of expanding Spanish influence will bring about increased profit for us later on and few will be able to resist the pull of Spanish markets."
 ara_centralized_estates: "Command the Spanish Estates"
 ara_centralized_estates_desc: "As for what can be done with Spanish land directly underneath the crown... Well, unruly estates must be put back in line, should they not? For too long we have seen the clergy and the nobility run their own local affairs without Spanish interests being at their heart which has led to various struggles for power that boil upwards to the monarch. It is time we take firm control over these estates and make them bow to the Spanish crown once and for all."
 lon_the_true_iberian: "Truth in our Blood"
 lon_the_true_iberian_desc: "The people of Leon and those of Leonese descent know that they are indeed the true holders of Iberia and were destined to be as such had it not been for the fiends of Castile stealing power away from the leaders of Leon. Now that we are unified with the true blood of the Leonese leading the way, there will very few who can question our authority."
 lon_dominant_leonese_dialect: "The Leonese Dialect"
 lon_dominant_leonese_dialect_desc: "Much like how the Castilians slowly spread their dialect throughout their lands, Leonese will now spread throughout the land we hold and steadily assimilate other languages into it. Perhaps in the future, we can even form a foundation of sorts dedicated to keeping our language enforced without much change over time."
 lon_schools_of_iberia: "Schools of Iberia"
 lon_schools_of_iberia_desc: "To further promote the intellectual pursuits of Spanish people and to keep them on par with the likes of the rest of Europe, we must be keen on building libraries, schools, and universities all across Iberia. Basic literacy, geography, philosophy, mathematics, and science must all be taught to our people if we wish to strengthen ourselves internally."
 gal_santiago_de_compostela: "Santiago de Compostela in Galicia"
 gal_santiago_de_compostela_desc: "The city of Santiago de Compostela, grand is it not? Holding the fabeled Way of St. James's ending, the city is very much a pilgramage site for Catholics around Europe and it has led to a great deal of zealousness amongst our missionaries and priests. We need to keep them reined in as time goes on, but their zeal should not be left to wither away in our lands; they can safely promote the faith in our own land when it is needed."
 gal_bishoprics_of_iberia: "The Bishoprics of Iberia"
 gal_bishoprics_of_iberia_desc: "The bishoprics were once a key factor in the politics of Iberia and at times, clergy officials could easily hold sway over certain parts of kingdoms and duchies. The time has come to centralize power toward the crown of Spain, but we can still find use in these old bishoprics when it comes to hiring good leaders to help organize our military. They had experience with doing such in centuries past, why can't they help us out now?"
 gal_righteous_catholic_bastion: "The Rightous Bastion"
 gal_righteous_catholic_bastion_desc: "The Spanish people are and have always been righteous defenders of Catholicism throughout their time on the peninsula as independent entities. From the times of Asturias and Galicia to the times of Portugal and Aragon, our people have been loyal to the one true faith, garnering us a rather fitting reputation as a defender of the faith."
 cat_luxury_of_iberia: "Luxuries of Iberia"
 cat_luxury_of_iberia_desc: "Iberia is full of luxury goods if one can search for them in the right markets and the right communities. Places like Barcelona, Valencia, and Zaragoza should be promoted to higher standings in Spanish land so that they can truly become the epitome of an empire taking in all the trade Europe has to offer."
 cat_harbor_emphasis: "Emphasize the Harbors"
 cat_harbor_emphasis_desc: "The various harbors of Iberia are alright for now, but they need to be built up even further later on if we are to compete with the likes of the French, the English, and the Italians! Catalan cities on the coast are perhaps some of the best for building ships and promoting naval interests for Spain so those should be prioritized first, and then harbors around the rest of Iberia should be focused on."
 cat_mercantile_expertise: "Mercnatile Lens on the World"
 cat_mercantile_expertise_desc: "Emphaisis on our Catalan heritage makes us more keen on trade and naval dominance as one might expect. The glistening cities of Barcelona and Valencia are what we should be striving to make throughout all Spanish lands, and within these cities shall be grand markets that have trade power on levels the Venetians and Genoese could only dream of."
 nav_rugged_terrain_traders: "Cross-Region Traders"
 nav_rugged_terrain_traders_desc: "The Basque people are a strange sort of people in Iberia, but they're influential in mercantile politics as well as dynastic politics. These Basque connections in the French region and the in the lands of the English and Irish could be just the thing that Spain needs to profit hugely, though it will take time to ensure these connections are solid enought to build on."

 nav_blending_of_iberian_identities_desc: "If Castilians and Leonese people can accept the Basque people into the Iberian fold, there isn't any reason why they wouldn't be able to accept others into the fold as well. The Basque language alone is enough to put off many people as it is radically different to any language around it, but seeing as it is a key facet of Spanish culture as a whole, perhaps people are becoming more accepting as time goes on."
 nav_importing_ideas: "Import Foreign Ideas"
 nav_importing_ideas_desc: "Foreigners can be met with suspicion in Spanish lands, but they shouldn't be put off forever. As time goes on, we'll foster a more diplomatically open and cordial attitude in the Spanish people. Even though they might be staunchly Catholic in their ways, culturally they can be accepting, and foreign ideas should not be much of an issue if the ideas can indeed be a benefit to our society as a whole."

 plc_prosperous_folwarks_desc: "A nobleman's landholding in the Commonwealth is usually comprised of what we call a folwark. It is a large farm worked by various serfs to produce surpluses for trade that is both internal and external. So long as we can keep this system functional and perhaps reform the laws surrounding it over time, the folwark system will continue to contribute great amounts to our trade routes and our stockpiles."

 pol_jagiellonian_university_desc: "Established in 1364, Krakow's Jagiellonian University is perhaps one of the greatest places in all of Europe! It has brought in, taught, and cultivated a variety of philosophical and scientific minds the likes of which Europe could almost never live without, let alone the Polish and Lithuanian people. Going forth, Jagiellonian University will continue to be one of the brightest points in our grand Commonwealth."
 plc_the_obrona_potoczna: "Obrona Potoczna"
 plc_the_obrona_potoczna_desc: "What we term a 'continuous defense' is really a standing army that is paid for by the monarch from their own pocket. They are stationed traditionally in troubled areas or places where the border with a neighbor is not clearly defined so that Commonwealth interests are not intruded upon. Over time, this military sector of ours is going to yield for us highly trained soldiers and skilled generals who know just how to deal with enemies of all types, whether they're of Polish, Lithuanian, Ukranian, or foreign descent."
 pol_winged_hussars: "And the Winged Hussars Arrived!"
 pol_winged_hussars_desc: "As Europe moves from heavy cavalry to light cavalry, the Polish troops of the Commonwealth know that heavy cavalry are still very much able to deal great amounts of damage in battle if they are led correctly and armed with proper equipment. We will focus our efforts on cultivating the Winged Hussars as much as we can and build our military tactics around how the heavy cavalry should perform in battle."
 plc_refine_our_golden_liberty: "Refinement of Golden Liberty"
 plc_refine_our_golden_liberty_desc: "Our political doctrine: 'Our State is a republic under the presidency of the king'. It is by this statement that we abide by and the following aspects: having an election of a king by all nobles, a Sejm, a Pacta Conventa, religious freedom, legal right to rebel against a king who has violated guaranteed freedoms, liberum veto, and forming an organization to force a common political aim. By keeping these aspects of our republic enshrined and also refining them with new laws and legislation as we go forth, the Commonwealth will never become outdated nor stagnant in its politics."

 pol_royal_guards_desc: "Responsibly directly for the protection of the monarch and his family, the Polish Royal Guards are set to be the peak of Commonwealth power. Fitted with the best equipment we can obtain and trained in a variety of methods throughout their lives, the Polish Royal Guards will only embolden and harden our military in the future, especially our infantry, all whilst keeping the monarch and his family safe from harm."
 plc_tempered_by_neighbors: "Tempered by Neighbors"
 plc_tempered_by_neighbors_desc: "All around us there is conflict. Swedish people? Baltic conflicts. Hungarians? Border disputes. Teutons? Old grudges and lusts for land. Russians? Ambition for land on both sides. Time and time again we have been tested in combat since our borders in the east and west are hard to define beyond a hand-drawn map, but these times of war did not break down the Polish and Lithuanian people, it only made them stronger."
 lit_success_after_success: "Success after Success"
 lit_success_after_success_desc: "The history of the Lithuanian people is vast and expansive as it is, and our history as an independent state pushing eastward has been something of a great success story. Being unscathed by Mongol attacks and actually beating them back, and then later on diplomatically annexing or invading and taking over various small Slavic states, it is all part of how good of a state we have cultivated over the centuries."
 lit_vilnius_university: "Vilnius University"
 lit_vilnius_university_desc: "Vilnius has been a hub of Lithuanian culture and grandeur for centuries now (Grand Duke Gediminas relocated the capital to Vilnius in 1323), so it is only fitting that we start up a grand university inside of it! Vilnius University will become a beacon for Lithuanian people and will serve to help bring scholars of all fields to the lands of the Commonwealth regardless of their faith."

 lit_develop_eastward_desc: "The eastern portions of our land are full of open tracts of land that are ripe for development, but the people there are few and far between. We must subsidize these areas and begin to develop them into proper voidoeships so that they can not only contribute more taxs and manpower to the Commonwealth, but also help contribute to a stronger defensive line should any invasion come through those lands."

 legacy_of_the_antipopes_desc: "Previously, when the Papacy was in a state of chaos due to where the seat of Papal power was to be set at, two bishops of Parma became Antipopes. Honorius II (in opposition to Pope Alexander II) and Clement III (in opposition to Pope Gregory VII, Victor III, Urban II, and Paschal II) give Parma a legacy of partial Papal power that we should utilize whenever we can, and perhaps in the future, we should look into either usurping the Papacy for ourselves or lessening its central power from Rome itself."
 family_possessions_of_parma: "Family Obligations of Possessions"
 family_possessions_of_parma_desc: "Fiefs and holdings owned by various noble families in Parma are somewhat decentralized, not obeying every law from our central government, but they have their own benefits due to this method of governance. They pay for the upkeep in their own holdings and they also know that since Parma is in such a contested spot of the Italian Peninsula, there will need to be a great many defenders for each property they own. Let us hope that they hire men of quality instead of levying each peasant they see."
 heart_of_the_italian_wars: "Heart of the Italian Wars"
 heart_of_the_italian_wars_desc: "Parma is not known for being a strong military power, that is a fact, but it is also a fact that Parma is a great witness to the various Italian wars that rage on between Germanic, French, and Italian people. Parma must not just watch the blood spill on the floor in shock and horror, no, it must learn from the clashes of these various forces and attempt to cultivate some sort of refined military force as time goes on."
 university_and_nobles_college: "Ensuring Quality Education"
 university_and_nobles_college_desc: "We must see to it that the Parmigianos are taken care of with the best we can provide. We do not look to having a sprawling empire like the French or Spanish, we instead look to having a bustling urban center and a cultivated city full of educated and well rounded citizens. To promote our work in this area, we should certainly strive to have universities and colleges throughout Parma despite what financial costs they might incur."
 adjusting_the_power_of_barons: "Power Adjustments"
 adjusting_the_power_of_barons_desc: "Just as Parma progresses in its work to build a fine central city with a myriad of scholars and artisans living within it, Parma will need to enforce most strict laws and pass more defined legislation that outlines what rights and powers certain groups of people have. In accordance with this, adjusting the power of barons and noble families is a must, but we will not completely do away with them. If we were to cut them out entirely, Parma might face a revolt that could bring down all the prosperity it has built up so far."

 strive_for_the_future_of_ideas_desc: "Our strive to educate our own people and to emphasize our importance in our local area of the Italian Peninsula has been met with opposition throughout, but the opposition has only given life to new ideas! The schools of thought we foster are to be marveled at since they are giving Parmigiano people new perspectives on life, administration, taxation, trade, diplomacy, and almost every other aspect of life and statecraft one could think of!"

 primed_for_enlightened_ideas_desc: "It is thanks to our will to educate our people and our willingness to confront new ideas head on that Parma is where it is. Few can doubt the quality of our schools, and fewer still can doubt how many scholars of great quality our universities give rise to. What must be done now is to spread this slowly rising standard of education toward all parts of Parmigiano society."

Though some would overlook our humble diocese as nothing more than a place of Bavarians and Austrians gathering to worship, many know the great reputation Passau has from its past alongside its greatly rebuilt monasteries. This reputation will only serve to enhance the trust we have from our own people, and it will help pave the way for a bright future in Passau."
 stamp_of_the_passau_wolf: "Stamp of the Wolf"
 stamp_of_the_passau_wolf_desc: "If there is one matter that Passau is becoming known for as the Age of Exploration makes its way across the Old World, it is that bladed weapon manufacturing is a key component of Passau's prosperity! Our smiths stamp the blades with the glorious Passau wolf, a simplified rendering of our coat-of-arms that ensures that all know exactly where the blade has come from. These high quality weapons may not be the best against muskets but they do inspire a great many stories of heroism amongst those who use them, especially the soldiers of our own ranks."

 franciscans_and_dominicans_in_passau_desc: "To help spread the good word of Passau to other parts of Europe, we should be willing to invite in various high-ranking officials from the holy orders around Europe. Franciscans, Dominicans, even Jesuits would be fitting to invite to our land so that in the future, we may attract future theologians, philosophers, artists, and other skilled people of various professions."
 heresy_at_every_step_of_passau: "Heresy! Everywhere!"
 heresy_at_every_step_of_passau_desc: "The Protestant Reformation does not waver in its effort to bring about ruin and destruction across the whole of the Holy Roman Empire. From east to west and north to south, princes and bishops turn on each other so that one religious side may triumph claim that they have the truest interpretation of the Bible, its theology, and the doctrines of faith itself. Passau is caught in the middle of these violent clashes and will need to choose a side before one side enforces its religious demands upon the other in our own land."
 who_should_rule_over_passau: "A Powerful Question to Passau"
 who_should_rule_over_passau_desc: "Who can rule over Passau is not an easy question to answer as some think they should be elected from a religious background instead of a meritocratic background. There are also others who think noble blood stands out and should be enthroned to Passau's highest position, but we care not for these trivial aspects. What we need to focus on is where our candidate comes from. If they come from a Bavarian family, an Austrian family, a Bohemian family, or perhaps some other family in general, they will grant us certain advantages when it comes to relations with those around us."
 revoke_the_power_from_vienna: "The Rival Diocese"
 revoke_the_power_from_vienna_desc: "Vienna is so beloved by the Austrians and Papacy that it got its own diocese... How wonderful... Though some rejoice that Vienna got this attention, we of Passau resent it greatly! The ecclesiastic power of Vienna partly comes at a cost of our ecclesiastic power! The Diocese of Vienna will not stand forever, and we of Passau will be dedicated to retaking what power was taken from us. After all is done, the various deacons and priests and other holy officials that would've gone to Vienna can instead come to Passau, as they always should have done."
 enlargen_passaus_religious_influence: "The Taste of Power"
 enlargen_passaus_religious_influence_desc: "We have tasted power in the past and as of late, though we are not in a strong position to challenge strong states around us. Even to defend ourselves, the forces of Passau are rather small and weak, ineffective at stopping any advance from neighboring princes that might be eager to dismantle our power. Taking measures to formalize and build up the military potential of Passau should be a steady project for all inside our borders."

 rotenburg_castle_at_our_heart_desc: "Established in about 1195, Rotenburg Castle has remained the residency for the Prince-Bishops of Verden since its inception. It serves as a status symbol and a good defensive structure to protect Verden from any ambitious ruler of Bremen, Luneburg, or some other state, though we must always keep in mind that the castle needs to be reworked and updated as time goes on."
 how_much_power_does_the_papacy_have: "The Fine Lines of Religious Power"
 how_much_power_does_the_papacy_have_desc: "Papal power in the far north is not as strong as it used to be as fissures within the Catholic faith are emerging as time goes on. We of Verden must choose a path in the near future and outline specifically where the boundaries of religious authority are since it is clear to all that religion mixing into international politics is causing more divides and more lives to be lost."
 love_hate_relations_with_bremen: "Love-Hate Relations with Bremen"
 love_hate_relations_with_bremen_desc: "At times we have ruled in tandem with the Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen, but these unions were never true personal unions of any sort. Rather, the relations between Bremen and Verden have been quite hostile at times since Bremen has more foundational power and thus more ambition. We should at least use the good relations we do have with Bremen to hire more skilled courtiers so that we of Verden can benefit from the times of peace between the two states."
 provisions_of_being_immediate: "Advantages of Imperial Immediacy"
 provisions_of_being_immediate_desc: "Much like how Bremen is of imperial immediacy, Verden has this status in much the same way. It yields a great amount of benefits for both of us, though we take it in a different direction than they do since we are more focused on building up internally instead of controlling a myriad of religious territories and such. Being of imperial immediacy will in fact attract highly skilled advisors to Verden that will be able to grant us a great amount of influence in the future."
 politics_of_the_circles: "Intricate Holy Roman Politics"
 politics_of_the_circles_desc: "The Imperial Circles are administrative groupings in the Holy Roman Empire that serve to organize common defenses and collect taxes from the land. They also help organize the Imperial Diet when it convenes, and Verden being part of one of these circles means it can step up into higher level politics as compared to what it can normally get into. Experience with these administrative groupings will help refine our diplomatic sector and also serve to help us learn about the intricacies of foreign affairs."
 controlling_verdens_politics: "Protection of Internal Cohesion"
 controlling_verdens_politics_desc: "We have worked hard to ensure that our political situation internally isn't threatened by massive unrest or foreign dynasties. Though some dynasties remain prominent in Verden and some groups of people try to sway things in a single, unilateral way, our Prince-Bishop and those close to him are always working to ensure that these efforts to thwart our stability and infiltrate our state are fended off."
 slow_acquisition_of_power: "Keep Verden Growing"
 slow_acquisition_of_power_desc: "We strive to grow in a number of ways and we are always seeking to accomadate people within our borders though some would think that our efforts are not enough for those that aren't of strict Verdian descent. Working on understanding the differences and being tolerant of differences of new people coming into our fold will help Verden prosper and become less of a center of unrest... We can let Bremen handle that sort of tension..."

Rupert of Salzburg did good in his foundational days of starting such a magnificent structure for the heirs to his power, and now we today should do as previous rulers of Salzburg have done: keep it in the best possible condition no matter what happens."
 to_side_with_the_holy_see: "History of Papal Sidings"
 to_side_with_the_holy_see_desc: "Various controversies have rocked the Holy Roman Empire over the centuries and Salzburg, being so close to Austria whilst being a Prince-Archbishopric, has had to take sides in the various disputes. We tend to side with the Holy See and see them as the rightful powers in these political arguments which gives a degree of positive reputation with fellow Catholics, and keeping to this honesty will only help Salzburg's reputation grow in the future."
 the_notion_of_a_diet: "Convene the Diet of Salzburg"
 the_notion_of_a_diet_desc: "Despite being a Prince-Archbishopric, we cannot live without the usual institutions of a standard state. Merchants, peasants, knights and officers, and also clergy are spread throughout Salzburg and have their own interests aside from what we in the administration want. In order to help sort out these desires, we should look to convene some sort of diet for all of Salzburg so that we can better align all parts of the state toward common goals."

 choices_for_salzburgs_people_desc: "There are those in Salzburg who think that the Protestant Reformation will bring about its destruction what with the violence spreading and the politics becoming all the more murky as time goes on. We know this is not the truth, but we cannot deny that times will be hard for our population all around. The time has come for those of Salzburg to make the choice on what their faith for the future will be."
 university_of_salzburg: "University of Salzburg"
 university_of_salzburg_desc: "Rebuilding from the mess of religious struggles is going to be difficult, but not impossible. Starting off with a university to attract both local and international scholars and theologians will help bring Salzburg back to life whilst also building its characteristic faithfulness back up to where it once was."
 strength_over_the_mercantile_class: "Clergy over Merchants"
 strength_over_the_mercantile_class_desc: "The time has come for stricter regulations to come over the merchants and burghers of Salzburg. Though we understand they have needs that Salzburg needs to address as time goes on, they bring with them more corruption and foreign interference than actual ducats into our treasury. Letting the clergy and peasants handle things will be much better for Salzburg later on."
 militarized_prince_bishopric: "Extend our Temporal Control"
 militarized_prince_bishopric_desc: "Though we are limited partially by our spiritual characteristic bestowed upon us by the Holy See, the influence of the Holy See is not as strong as it once was. We can slowly begin to take military matters into our own hands and start creating a strong military for ourselves. Perhaps even doing conquests in our own name instead of the name of the Papacy? Well, we shall see how far that goes, but we are optimistic!"

Though the Holy Roman Empire and the Papal States may fight over the fate of Italy's northern portion, we of Modena are a sort of balancing factor that help bolster stability between the two influential giants. Such a status is enviable by other states since we are in essence a necessary political entity that must be had around."

Long will Modena stand and long will be look toward the future!"

Thankfully we can manage most of our politics through careful planning and honest deals, unlike how in larger states like Austria or France where corruption and backroom deals are rife."

 prestige_inside_modena_desc: "Scholars from all across Europe are travelling far and wide, bringing their prestige and luxury wherever they go. If we can build ourselves up internally and fund the construction of some high-class educational facilities, Modena will be able to foster its own prestigious scholarly class of people."
 tangled_in_italian_politics: "Tangled in Italian Politics"
 tangled_in_italian_politics_desc: "Being in the Italian Peninsula means we are also subject to the many intricacies of Italian politics. Places such as Venice, Siena, Roma, Lucca, Genoa, and Milan all push and pull on the various political ropes found throughout the peninsula and of Modena are adding to this in the same way that they do. It is time we invest honest time and effort into working out who are the friends and enemies of Modena before we become an unfortunate victim in these lands."

 engineering_for_success_desc: "The efforts to build up Modena's internal structures has resulted in a great number of engineers and builders who are adept at capturing the exact details in luxury and functionality that we of Modena both want and need.

 alpine_trade_rites_desc: "The mountains that divide the Italian Peninsula from the rest of Europe are rough to pass through, especially when snow blocks several passages, but Tirol is a path that can be traversed with some ease. This simple fact has made Tirol a valuable trade stop for those who wish to cross the mountains and as such makes taxing trade that comes through our land a natural thing. Safe passage is something that should always be valued!"

 tirol_castle_hold_strong_desc: "With the first castle being built before 1100, the second phase of construction happening in 1139-1140, and the final construction taking place in the late 1200s under Meinhard II of Gorizia-Tirol, this castle has served as the central piece of power for Tirol. Without it, we would not be as significant as we are nor as hard to invade. If we are to continue being a strong force in the mountain passes well into the future, it would serve us well to preserve our castle to the best extent possible."
 winter_advantages: "A Friend of Winter"
 winter_advantages_desc: "Have you ever tried to cross these moutains in the winter on foot or on horseback? Both are equally terrible endeavors and many have died trying to do one or the other for military or civilian purposes. We of Tirol know the perils of these mountains all too well and thus make it so that the winter snows work for our defensive plans instead of against our general military strategies. We will see if our enemies are dull enough to fall face first into the mountain of snow they'll face."
 mineral_wealth_of_tirol: "Silver Linings"
 mineral_wealth_of_tirol_desc: "The silver mine of Tirol is perhaps the second half of our great importance to surrounding states. Minting coins and making luxury goods from silver is valued all across Europe and thus, business is always present for Tirol. When the opportunity to improve the method of mining out this silver is around, we will be the first to take it up without question."
 invest_in_tiroler_soldiers: "The Winter Soldiers"
 invest_in_tiroler_soldiers_desc: "Tiroler troops can become some of the hardiest troops in all of Europe, they only need to be trained in such a way that they can withstand freezing temperatures and harsh terrain. Traditionally we have had no need to do this but as politics begin to change around us, we need to start thinking about how we will defend ourselves from neighboring states. How do we do this? Well, it all starts with our military, does it not?"
 italian_or_german_are_we: "The Fine Lines of Diplomacy"
 italian_or_german_are_we_desc: "Tirol has a history of being intertwined with a number of dynasties which serves to both help and hinder Tirol itself. It can allow Tirol to ease tensions and get into fine diplomatic deals at times, but it can also make for the seat of power in Tirol to be claimed by a foreign state should things go wrong. Let us play our cards as best we can and navigate this political hall-of-mirrors carefully."
 natural_experts_in_finance: "Balance the Scales"
 natural_experts_in_finance_desc: "With our diplomacy secure and our military in a fine shape, finances are where our focuses will go to next. The scales of our economy have been balanced around the grand silver mine in our land, but it won't last forever unfortunately. Thankfully the money and inflation that it has caused for us has helped make Tiroler officials adept financiers over the decades, so as we adjust our financial prospects in the future, any economic downturns will affect us in a less significant way."

Yet our legacy lives on from when we were able to contest for this very title in the late 800s and even obtaining it for a short while with Lambert I and Lambert II of Spoleto. Though this historical light behind us is faint, we will use it as much as we possibly can to stake claims on the land around us, conquering what is rightfully belonging to those of Spoleto."
 papal_connections_and_alliances: "Friends in High Places"
 papal_connections_and_alliances_desc: "Because of the placement of Spoleto, the Papal States is and always has been a natural ally against rival states to the north and south. Cardinals and governors have done regular visits to Spoleto and make for good connections both in public and in private so that, in the future, we can better carry out any plans we have in regards to diplomacy."

 the_gift_of_spoleto_desc: "What do you want this Christmas season? Is it a new train set? A nice sweater? Well how about control over Spoleto as a Christmas gift? Indeed this was somewhat the case of the centuries from about the 900s to the 1000s as Spoleto was repeatedly 'gifted' to either the Papacy or other significant political players. Though we're not going to sell ourselves out like this, being so highly valued in the past and right now has its perks."
 the_ins_and_outs_of_central_italy: "Italian Crossings"
 the_ins_and_outs_of_central_italy_desc: "Spoleto itself is situated in a rather 'non-fertile' part of the Italian Peninsula and as such has had to contend with crossing hills for many years now. It builds up leg muscles in the short-term and helps build up effective means of navigating rough terrain in the long-term, the latter of which we are going to need for our troop movements in the future."
 stalwart_faith_of_spoleto: "Unshaken Religious Convictions"
 stalwart_faith_of_spoleto_desc: "Given where Spoleto is politically and how tumultuous the religious landscape in Europe is, it would be quite the piece of news to hear that Spoleto was uprooted from its ancestral faith. It is clear that the road ahead for us must truly be that of the Catholic Church as our loyalty to the church has been unshaken for many centuries, but if our faith truly does change for something else, it must mean that new faith has a truly monumental truth or truths, no?"
 loaning_our_swords_around_italy: "Loan Our Sword; Lend Your Sword"
 loaning_our_swords_around_italy_desc: "Like many other states in the Italian Peninsula, we of Spoleto are well versed in the notion of mercenaries. We loan out our troops to others for a fine bit of coinage, they lend us their swords in exchange for a few bags of coin, it's all a regular thing here. The more we deal in this area of warfare, the more Spoleto will benefit from it later on."

 learn_from_the_papacy_desc: "We should not just simply let the Papal States be a nice ally or a static rival of ours in the Italian Peninsula, especially since we have plenty of history with the Papal States via being under direct papal rule with a proper cardinal as governor. If we can uphold what we've learned from our years of being a papal fiefdom, then we will be able to make others bend to our will in similar ways that the Papacy does."

Though not as large as other Catholic dioceses or bishoprics, it has been here for long enough that it has ties to various parts of the land that now go under new names.

 refuge_and_ravaging_in_the_reformation_desc: "The Protestant Reformation has reached toward Ruppin just as it has reached toward every other part of Europe, yet for some it has been more damaging than rectifying. We of Ruppin must do our best to resolve the conflicts between Catholics, Protestants, Baptists, Calvinists, and whatever other denomination is within our land so that our own political establishment doesn't succumb to internal religious fissures."
 elbe_and_oder_river_productiveness: "Between the Elbe and Oder River"
 elbe_and_oder_river_productiveness_desc: "Our founding between these two signature rivers may be seen to some as mundane, but we know that there is potential in these lands if we can only utilize what production methods we have currently. Clearing some forests out of the way and harnessing some irrigation for our farms in a more efficient manner would do wonders for the productivity of Ruppin as a whole."
 saxon_and_brandenburg_claims: "A Place of Claims"
 saxon_and_brandenburg_claims_desc: "Being part of the Margraviate of Brandenburg for as long as we have, and also seeing how many conflicts have erupted between Brandenburg and its neighbors like Saxony, Ruppiner officials know that the land we stand on it a land of claims and of strategic value. Utilizing diplomatic connections in Brandenburg, Saxony, as well as any other states we are near could help in us making moves against our local rivals."
 local_minded_officials: "Knowing our People"
 local_minded_officials_desc: "Ruppin is very much a local power, it has been ever since its inception and the people who run our administration know this very well. As such they have come to understand local politics on a much deeper level than most other states like Austria, Bohemia, or Brandenburg. Coming to terms with local politics and local authorities is perhaps one of the biggest challenges to maintaining internal peace and productivity; thankfully we of Ruppin have no trouble in this area."

 there_is_life_in_this_body_yet_dec: "We are not thought of as a militaristic place at all, but rather as a place of rural localities and small-time merchants and officials. Such a reputation gives others a sense that we are weak and unable to defend against attacks, but that is far from the truth. Should we be threatened, all of Ruppin will be called upon to help defend the land regardless of their faith or creed. We stand and fight for righteousness in the face of being offered a torturous peace."

 welf_pieces: "Welf Dynastic Pieces"
 welf_pieces_desc: "The Welf Dynasty is something of a prestigious and well-known name throughout Central Europe, but it was never truly a centralized dynasty that could cultivate power and challenge other strong dynasties. The way inheritance went in the Welf Dynasty meant that its holdings got split up time and time again, leaving it with very little central power unfortunately. We of Calenberg are holders of one of these 'Welf pieces' and therefore our legitimacy in this land is helped by that alone, but finding connections in our family to the Welf Dynasty could always help us in that sense too."
 raise_up_the_vogtei_of_calenberg: "The Vogtei of Calenberg"
 raise_up_the_vogtei_of_calenberg_desc: "Traditionally, the title of 'advocatus' ('vogt' and 'vogtei' in Old High German) was given to those who were legally delegated to carry out some secular responsibilities of a feudal lord or insitution. This position may not be that common outside of the Holy Roman Empire but inside its borders, such a title brings with it more power than one might anticipate. If we of Calenberg can elevate our the power of our own Vogtei through various means (not excluding military conquest), then we will certainly be able to command more authority in our home region."
 expansion_of_calenberg_castle: "Expand Calenberg Castle"
 expansion_of_calenberg_castle_desc: "Built by Otto the Strict in 1292, Calenberg Castle has served as our place of central authority for decades upon decades now. Though Calenberg has traditionally been thought of as an undeveloped piece of land fit for only petty local authorities, Calenberg Castle stands as a place where we can project a growing sense of power from. If we renovate it and fortify it thoroughly over time, few will be able to break through its walls and threaten our power."
 development_of_oberwald_and_unterwald: "Oberwald and Unterwald Development"
 development_of_oberwald_and_unterwald_desc: "Calenberg has traditionally been known as the Lower Forest (Unterwald) whilst our other familial area, Gottingen, has been traditionally known as the Upper Forest (Oberwald). Whilst the forests do impede land development to a degree, we have proven with Calenberg Castle that developing our land is not impossible. Putting more funds toward developing strong infrastructure would actually help Calenberg a lot in comparison to other places in Central Europe, so both the Lower and Upper Forest can be of great use to us in the future as new forestry techniques come to light."
 religious_issues_brought_home: "And it Followed me Home..."
 religious_issues_brought_home_desc: "We didn't ask for the Protestant Reformation to disturb our towns and citizens, but it followed our clergy and devote people home... Now Calenberg is put face-to-face with religious tension unlike anything it has ever had to deal with, but which path is the righteous one? Which one do our people support? No matter the path that is chosen, we will take this time to concentrate on local affairs so that such a religious split like this does not spell the end for Calenberg."
 fortified_towns_of_calenberg: "The Defense of Calenberg's Towns"
 fortified_towns_of_calenberg_desc: "The various petty wars that are waged all across the Holy Roman Empire are usually nothing to note of by bigger powers like Saxony or Austria, but to Calenberg, these wars pose as threats and learning opportunities. If we can learn to fortify our towns effectively and train more local militia groups to fight back against incoming invaders, fewer and fewer enemies will dare encroach on our land for fear of what resistance they will face on the local level."
 contest_for_northern_power: "A Worthy Contestant"
 contest_for_northern_power_desc: "The lands to the north in the Holy Roman Empire are rife with surges and drops in power from various electors, princes, and bishoprics. Calenberg is part of this cycle and is proving to many in the north that it is capable of fending for itself and even becoming a true stronghold. Cultivating this power and influence amongst various cities and small princes will help them recognize our power when they eventually come into our fold."

 military_elite_amidst_greeks: "Military Elite Authority"
 military_elite_amidst_greeks_desc: "The Principality of Achaea was not greek in its founding at all, but rather it was state set up by William of Champlitte and Geoffrey I of Villehardouin in 1205 during the Fourth Crusade. Because of this foundation and how the entire principality was structured, it was clear to all from the outset that Achaea would be a French military elite ruling over a mostly Greek populace. This comes with its risks and rewards though, ranging from potential hostilities from the Greek people themselves to knowing just how to deal with rebellious people when they rise up."
 secular_baronies_of_achaea: "The 12 Baronies of Achaea"
 secular_baronies_of_achaea_desc: "Shortly after our founding, William of Champlitte (the first Prince of Achaea) sought to flesh out a proper administration over the land. He did this in 1208-1209 when he created a commission chaired by himself and also composed of two Latin bishops, two bannerets, and five Greek magnates. This commission assessed the land and divided it up as best they could but perhaps the most stand-out aspect of this commission's work was the creation 12 secular baronies. Though we have had to adjust these baronies as time has gone on and perhaps the number fluctuates up or down as we see fit, they allow for a more efficient way of taxing our citizens."
 prince_is_first_among_equals_to_the_baronies: "The Prince's Relation to the Baronies"
 prince_is_first_among_equals_to_the_baronies_desc: "In Achaea, we do not see the prince as being ruling with absolute authority like some other states do, but rather the prince is the 'first among equals' when it comes to his relation to the baronies of Achaea. In this respect, the baronies of our land can construct castles and hand out capital punishment as they see fit whilst also serving the prince in the field and garrison for portions of the year. Alongside this, women could inherit fiefs inside of Achaea due to the laws not being entirely based upon Salic Law, thus offering a slightly wider array of people available to our court."
 a_crux_of_east_west_conflict: "Violent Clashes between East and West"
 a_crux_of_east_west_conflict_desc: "Founded in the midst of the Fourth Crusade and seeing our own demise in the fires of dynastic conflict and the struggles of the Byzantines, we of Achaea know exactly what fighting between eastern people and western people is like. Achaea itself has had to adapt to these prospects over the decades through constructing new castles, allying certain states, or purely learning to fight with more heart and more discipline. It is this last aspect that we must cultivate most of all though since we are in such a precarious position, for if we cannot rely on proper defenses or worthy allies, we must defend the land with our bodies and weapons alone."
 the_the_great_court_and_assizes_of_romania: "The Great Court; Assizes of Romania"
 the_the_great_court_and_assizes_of_romania_desc: "All secular and ecclesiastical lords participated in the council known as the 'Grand Court', which was and still is headed by the prince. It has a large amount of authority in Achaea and its decisions are binding not only to the people below the prince, but also to the prince himself. On top of this Grand Court, the Assizes of Romania were produced between the 1200s and 1400s whilst our principality was still alive and well despite dynastic claims hampering things. The Assizes of Romania helped blend Byzantine laws with French law and has helped Achaea and other Greek polities achieve a modicum stability with regards to laws of the land."
 emulate_william_ii_villehardouin: "Emulate William II Villehardouin"
 emulate_william_ii_villehardouin_desc: "Perhaps the greatest prince Achaea ever had, William II (reigned: 1246 - 1278) was French in descent by highly cultured in regards to almost every aspect about him. Not only was he a prince who desired land and rightfully obtained it through the conquest of the rest of the Peloponnese, he was a poet and a troubadour who achieved a flourishing literary culture within the court of Achaea itself. Though he became embroiled in the politics of the Byzantines and the other small states around in the 1200s, his legacy lives on within us and it is our duty to carry on his legacy of both a vibrant court and a grand vision of conquest combined with literacy."
 dynastic_claims_everywhere: "The Mess of Dynastic Claims"
 dynastic_claims_everywhere_desc: "The fall of the Principality of Achaea in the early part of the 1400s was the result of dynastic claims tearing away at our insides and also the then strong Despotate of Morea taking advantage of the turmoil occurring. We may have been fated to die a sorrowful death back then, but we are much stronger now compared to back then and we can capitalize on these dynastic feuds in this current age as opposed to how futile we were when various dynasties from across Europe sought out our land through inheritance or conquest."

 versus_the_crusaders_desc: "When the Frankish Principality of Achaea conquered southward under Prince William II Villehardouin, they lost at the Battle of Pelagonia against Michael VIII Palaelogus and the enemy prince was captured. Such a valuable capture in battle led to the southern part of the Peloponnese being surrendered to the Byzantines and thus, it became the heart of the Despotate of Morea. Born in fire and bloodshed, Morea's regiments of fine soldiers and cavalry know all too well that what they fight for is the livelihood of the despotate and potentially all that graciously Greek in this world."
 invitations_to_outside_settlers: "Friends of Morea, Welcome!"
 invitations_to_outside_settlers_desc: "The economy of Morea is nothing too great as the land has been used by countless generations of Greeks whilst also coming under the torment of foreign armies marching through. In order to help reinvigorate the communities who till the land, we should invite settlers to Morea and be much more open to who comes to and from our land. Encouraging upward population growth should help us rebound from the depths of economic uncertainty."
 fortifications_like_the_hexamilion_wall: "The Hexamilion Wall Emulated"
 fortifications_like_the_hexamilion_wall_desc: "The only land connection to the Peloponnese has historically been along the Isthmus of Corinth, with this passage way being guarded by the mighty Hexamilion Wall built between 408AD and 450AD, during the reign of Theodosius II. Morea must take the Hexamilion Wall as an example of what kind of fortifications it can and should build, ones that last a long time and that can be improved upon as time goes on whilst also being stationed at key strategic points so that our enemies will have the hardest time possible besieging them."
 battles_for_aegean_dominance: "Ruthless Naval Warfare"
 battles_for_aegean_dominance_desc: "Morea's navy has never been anything serious when compared to the naval forces of Venice, Naples, or any other serious Mediterannean power, but we still have had plenty of experience fighting hostile ships in small-scale battles in the Aegean Sea. We should be learning from these various naval skirmishes and trying to improve our sailors and ships as much as we can so that we can overcome any foreign threat out on the open water."
 venetian_ties_throughout_morea: "Influential Venetian Merchants"
 venetian_ties_throughout_morea_desc: "Merchants from Venice are common in the Aegean Sea; they have been for centuries and will most likely continue to spread their influence far and wide. Over where we are, Morea is perhaps the prime beneficiary of Venice's outward influence since Venetian merchants do good business with Morean traders instead of Muslim traders to the north and east. Through these Venetian merchants, we will learn to refine our own trade practices and become a Greek entrepot."
 communication_between_our_forts: "From Fortress to Fortress"
 communication_between_our_forts_desc: "The various fortifications throughout Morea are strong in their own right, but they lack proper communication between their various locations. Whether we build dirt or paved roads or try set up various stations to facilitate communication between them, Morea needs them to be able to relay messages across the land so that a more effective resistance to enemy forces may be coordinated. Even partisans from local towns can be called upon by this enhanced communication system should the times call for it."
 new_home_for_greek_power: "Haven for Greeks"
 new_home_for_greek_power_desc: "The Despotate of Morea is a dim beacon of hope for Greek people, but one that shines nonetheless. Byzantium once stood as the bastion of Greek culture and tradition, but perhaps it is time for that torch to be passed on to their children who are more capable of bearing the weight of such a legacy. Such a legacy will be guarded at all costs and the military of Morea is prepared to fight to the very last man should said legacy be threatened."

 the_constitution_of_padua_desc: "Starting the in early 1000s, political movements around Padua made it necessary that our city establish for itself a constitution and a proper administrative body for governance purposes. Though some like Venice and the Papal States do not care for our constitution, it is perhaps the foundational pillar by which we have held to for centuries now, and it is a pillar that we will continue to build off of well into the future."

 memories_of_the_league_desc: "The days of the Lombard League are long gone seemingly, but its memories are very much still alive in Padua to this day. The intrusion of the Holy Roman Empire to the north and the refusal to fully submit by cities from Northern Italy continues to give Paduan people hope and morale whenever an invade comes through to besiege our settlements."

 learn_from_defeats_due_to_venice_desc: "Our defeats by the Republic of Venice have made things rather difficult in Padua, but things are not as hopeless as they might seem. Our administrative body has learned from the past and knows just how vital a strong standing military can be; encouraging the build up of land forces for the defense of Padua will henceforth be one of our highest priorities."

 build_up_the_university_of_padua_desc: "Founded in 1222 by students and folks from Bologna, our noble university is filled with scholars of all fields of study. But is it enough for Padua? Is the university large enough to house intellectuals from even more fields of study as time goes on? The answer to that is, of course it isn't! Thus, we must be ready to build up the University of Padua with more facilities and areas of study so that we can continue to attract more righteous and forward-thinking scholars."
 insight_into_humanism: "Humanist Ideas Expanded Upon"
 insight_into_humanism_desc: "Many around us in the Italian Peninsula are concerned with theological insights, mercantile prospects, mercenary contracts, or artistic splendor. Padua, however, is concerned more with the notion of humanism combined with Christianity itself; we wish to have a population that is strongly civic minded and that can participate in civic processes that involve their land and matters that affect their own lives. Despite Padua being a small center for this new notion of humanism, we can ensure that it becomes a staple part of scholarly work in the future."

 the_upstart_city_once_again_desc: "It is not a particularly glorious or easy path, but the path to Paduan prominence is what we are destined to walk along.

 blessed_by_saint_maurice_desc: "St. Maurice of the Theban Legion in the 3rd Century was a peculiar figure and one who, according to the tales we have been passed down, refused to harm fellow Christians despite the orders from his superiors. It is this stalwart attitude in the face of what we know is wrong that strengthens the faith of those in Coburg, and the martial tradition that St. Maurice inherited from his time in the Theban Legion can be somewhat emulated in Coburg's own soldiers. Fight for faith, and fight for Coburg!"

 develop_the_regality_of_coburg_desc: "If we are to ever be with the highest echelons of royalty throughout Europe, Coburg must be fit to host some fine banquets and ceremonies. Doing this will of course require us to develop the land of Coburg properly and build up infrastructure to get proper building materials, hireable artisans, and competent engineers. Once we've done this, we will be well on our way to becoming a true royal state in Europe."
 the_reformation_in_coburg: "At the Edge of Turmoil"
 the_reformation_in_coburg_desc: "As the Protestant Reformation reaches out to every corner of Europe, we of Coburg cannot help but feel its harsh effects on our population. Divided down to the familial level in many cases, the Protestant Reformation is for many nothing but a horrid showing of what religious divides can do to people. But, our administration is finding good lessons in the fires of religious violence as they are realizing just efficient a tolerant and integrated administration can be."
 disconnected_and_reconnected: "Shady Inheritances"
 disconnected_and_reconnected_desc: "As all of the Holy Roman Empire knows, inheritance can be a tricky subject and it can often lead to disconnected and strangely shaped territories. Coburg is no stranger to this and our royalty are keen on seeing that any split up pieces of Coburg are united into the central royal domain. Considering how inheritance laws can be manipulated too in places around us, connecting our various pieces together shouldn't be too hard."
 royalty_preserved_in_style: "Refined Aesthetic Taste"
 royalty_preserved_in_style_desc: "As Coburg grows and becomes stronger internally, the aesthetic taste of our people is becoming more refined as well. Reviving old styles and reinventing them with more modern construction techniques and modern materials will go a long way to helping us achieve the prestige and honor that we desire, and it will also help us obtain the influence we desire with other states around us."

 invest_in_long_term_structures_desc: "And as we pursue our refined taste in artistic structures, we must not forget about the functionality in our many buildings. Whether they are simple houses and manors or places of creation like forges and foundries, these places can all benefit from Coburg's focus on aesthetics and methods of construction. As the years go by, we will see that our engineers and builders will be some of the best that Europe has to offer."

The politically minded people of Hainaut saw the inept policies of the Burgundian monarchs not as a call for war at every given moment, but rather as a learning point that could later be implemented in a better form of government. Let us where these ideas are fully realized."

 calls_for_estates_general_desc: "The policies of the Burgundian monarchs made many cities around Hainaut and also including Hainaut call for the Estates-General. This gathering of the three principle estates of the land (the clergy, nobility, and the Third Estate) is but one step toward improving upon the policies of governance that the Burgundians had put forth. Hainaut should and will improve upon the Estates-General over time and see to it that more people in the land get representation as time goes on."

 punching_above_our_weight_desc: "Much like the other cities of the Low Countries, Hainaut can and has punched above its weight in battles before. When contributing to the Burgundian cause in various conflicts to defending our own land when need be, we can be sure to always hold the line in battle to the very end. Any nation that is able to get our forces on their side will surely be thankful for our support."
 lessons_of_personal_unions: "Lessons of Personal Unions"
 lessons_of_personal_unions_desc: "Many in and around Hainaut know just how these lands came under the authority of Burgundy: through the notion of personal unions. What Hainaut and its highest officials have learned from this time of being under subjugation is that flexible diplomacy and a strong royal house is what keeps certain states independent, and if Hainaut can master having a solid diplomatic sector whilst maintaining its own royal dynasty, it will be able to keep its own power safe from competition."
 consolidate_the_hainaut_economy: "Consolidation of the Economy"
 consolidate_the_hainaut_economy_desc: "As our diplomacy develops upward, our city must also develop at the same time. Through trade is where we gain most of our profits and it is through attracting more and more merchants to come to our city that we will thrive in the future. Such is the fate of places like Holland and Brabant, such will be our fate too since taxes and military conquest are something we cannot always rely on."
 lack_of_expansion_chances: "Lack of Military Conquest"
 lack_of_expansion_chances_desc: "Where we lack in military capability for conquest we will make up for in developing the infrastructure of Hainaut. As we concentrate our efforts on improving our trade outlook, it would do us well to also work to improve our markets, our defensive structures, our manors and houses, and even our military camps. Developing internally is what will help Hainaut survive in the hostile climate that is European politics."

 focus_on_diplomatic_matters_desc: "If it wasn't for our time under the authority of Burgundy, where would Hainaut be? Just another province of the French? Or perhaps another prince in the Holy Roman Empire? Both are probable outcomes, but for now, Hainaut is looking upward with its diplomacy and its royalty. We work toward steadily improving the lives of our people; we work toward building stronger structures with firm functions; and most of all, we work toward making sure that we have strong allies through confident and prudent negotiations."

Though the Wettin Dynasty is relegated to the annals of history, we of Meissen in this current age benefit from the work they did to build up the lands of Meissen.

Despite the amount of time that has passed though, Meissen can still press claims from long ago that it once had and see to it that claims from the Electorate of Saxony are partially enforced too (though the later is something that needs more work since we are not exactly the Electorate of Saxony)."

 old_influences_around_the_hre_desc: "Meissen was influential in these olden times as well, having connections in many places thanks to the prominence of the Wettin Dynasty. If we can rekindle these old relationships and take advantage of what ties we still have whilst also building up new ties to other dynasties, Meissen will be in a much stronger position diplomatically."

 establish_a_religious_stance_desc: "The lands of Meissen are not spared the religious fire of the Protestant Reformation and it forces us to confront the burning question at hand: Do we choose Catholicism, Protestantism, or one of the various Reformed branches? It isn't a simple cut-and-dry answer for many states and we of Meissen struggle wit the religious debate here and there, but we need to have an answer before religious conflict ruins us. Once our stance is firmly shaped, we can work toward uniting our own people around it."

Coming from the lands to the far east and made with immense care and precision, these works of art are seen in the highest echelons of royalty all throughout Europe for good reason. Officials in Meissen insist that we work on improving our production methods so that we can produce this kind of luxury product here since it could seriously improve our economic prospects, and who are we to say no to something like this?"

We did not back down when these families went against us since they threatened a bastion of God's grace on this very earth, no, instead we turned the tables on them and strived to make gains against them so as to secure our borders and our politics. These rivalries will forever be known in Aquileia's history and they will give us a strong position when taking to future rivals."

 alpine_border_of_aquileia_desc: "The mountains to our capital's north are a hinderance to many who pass through them and controlling the select passes that allow passage during winter times can make Aquileia a valuable place.

 lessons_from_natural_disasters_desc: "It was in the 1300s that Aquileia was at its lowest point to many. Ravaged by earthquakes and other mishaps, the capital city was nearly abandoned altogether because of these events. Thus, the capital of the Patriarchate moved to Cividale, then to Udine, and then finally to Friuli where a bustling and robust city began to grow. It is from this series of events in the 1300s that we must learn from so that in the future, when disasters fall upon our land, we can rebuild whatever cities are affected in a quicker and more efficient manner."

Dominated by favorable politics and in comparison to us, Venice took advantage of our internal disunity and formally annexed the Patriarchate of Aquileia in 1433 and sought to secularize our land. Their effort has been met with resistance though, and now a resurgent Aquileia is at hand and ready to combat whatever Venice might throw at us."

 sort_out_the_vassal_feuds_desc: "One factor that helped lead to Aquileia's collapse in the past was internal feuding between various subjects, all of which took a toll on the administration and military we had at the time. Working on a closer level with our subject states and integrating their administration into our own at various points will help keep these feuds to a minimum, and if we can prevent any feuds from happening in the future, we will have a supremely stable state."
 under_the_guidance_of_christianity: "Guided by God"
 under_the_guidance_of_christianity_desc: "Our state is guided by the principles of Christianity more so than others in the Italian Peninsula (save for the Papal States of course), yet we don't rely entirely on Christian doctrine for our politics and military. Despite this though, our people from all walks of life are devoted to the faith and are devoted to living it out in their day-to-day lives, or at least ot the best of their ability. Bishops, cardinals, deacons, and priests are welcome in Aquileia at all times, for this land has and will continue to be a land guided by God."

 ensure_the_parliament_stays_desc: "The parliament of Friuli was once a sort of makeshift government body in the Patriarchate of Aquileia in the 1200s, but by the end of the 1200s, it had become a strong institution in Aquileia that helped voice the interests of the people of Friuli and the military of the state. Meeting up to ten times a year and especially during important vacancies of the patriarchal office, we should continue to utilize this parliament system to help build trust in the government from the ground up."

 no_jews_allowed_desc: "Since the pogrom of 1349 where over 1000 Jews were publicly burned to death, we have been a city free from the menace of Jewish people! We have a strict enforcement of the laws in which Jews are forbidden to stay in the city past 10PM and a special tax must be paid for any horse that a Jew would ride in on. Some would say that we take unreasonable measures to ensure that we are free from the influences of Jews, but we do not care for these opinions; we only care for the religious integrity of our dear city!"
 printing_the_deeds_of_strasbourg: "Printing the Deeds of Strasbourg"
 printing_the_deeds_of_strasbourg_desc: "Printing materials is revolutionary for many people in and around Strasbourg since it can spread information at an unprecedented rate. Though we know this power will not always be used for good, we can at least embrace the fact that printing books and manuscripts in greater numbers will help educate the population we have whilst also providing commerce potential unlike anything we have had before."
 control_of_newspapers: "Control the Weekly Newspapers"
 control_of_newspapers_desc: "Because the printing press has become a more regular thing inside of Strasbourg, newspapers have become a regular sight all throughout the city itself. Done in weekly batches usually, they are the perfect vector in which foreign powers could try to undermine our authority within the city itself, which is why we must control the newspapers as much as possible. If we are able to maintain this control despite the changes in politics around us, we will be much more stable and prosperous."
 humanist_thinking_for_christians: "Humanist Thoughts, for Christians"
 humanist_thinking_for_christians_desc: "The burst of new and innovative thoughts coming from the late 1400s and early 1500s means that Strasbourg is becoming a place where theologians and philosophers alike come to debate and expand their ideas. Though we may have severe disdain for heathens in our land, those proposing perhaps heretical ideas are more tolerable to us."
 methods_of_education_in_strasbourg: "Educate those of Strasbourg"
 methods_of_education_in_strasbourg_desc: "As the Protestant Reformation burns European cities to the core with religious strife, we of Strasbourg are doing our best to maintain a semblance of balance between Catholics and non-Catholics. If we can build a university space where these differing Christian minds can reasonably talk out their differences and sort through different doctrines in peace, we will benefit both from the peace maintained through the university space and also from the new ideas that stem from what these theologians and philosophers come up with."

 french_intrigues_in_our_land_desc: "Whilst we do benefit from protections inside the Holy Roman Empire, we cannot underestimate the lengths to which the French will go to secure the lands that straddle the border of both France and the Holy Roman Empire. Strasbourg is just one of those cities and we need to ensure that our defensive measures are some of the best around if we are to halt any French advance through our land."
 independent_high_fashion: "Strasbourg High Fashion"
 independent_high_fashion_desc: "And yet, being on the border between these two gigantic powers of Europe means that we have developed a unique sense of high culture and fashion within the highest ranks of our nobility. Strasbourg may be famous for a myriad of other things, but one more thing we can add to that list is the fact that no other noble family will look quite as nice and unique as the noble families from Strasbourg."

 invasions_from_all_sides: "The Invasions of Malta"
 invasions_from_all_sides_desc: "Malta's geography both in-person and on a political map means that it is important to a variety of powers that border the Mediterranean Sea. Our gracious island has thus witnessed plenty of invasions from all directions over the centuries, and with each invasion came with it new people and new experiences that helped build up the culture of Malta. But, as we build up a firm state for ourselves, we will need to make sure these invasions of our island come to a halt via our navy and what coastal defenses we have."
 maltas_universita: "The Universita"
 maltas_universita_desc: "For quite some time, the usual body of governance on Malta has been the 'universita'. It is not as all-encompassing as a monarchy, but it serves the people of Malta well enough because of how things are geographically and politically. It would do us well if we kept the univerista and refined it over time."
 the_midst_of_the_sea: "In the Midst of the Sea"
 the_midst_of_the_sea_desc: "Malta is a threat to some small states in the Mediterranean Sea, but it is the grim reality that other states are much more of a threat to Malta itself. Being where we are in this grand sea, we will need to build more docks and shipyards to uphold a strong navy that can defend Malta whilst also promoting its trade interests in the nearby island of Sicily and the trade hub that is Tunis."
 lessons_from_tunisian_raids: "Learn from Hostile Raids"
 lessons_from_tunisian_raids_desc: "The raids from North Africa are not unknown to Maltese people, but infact they are some of the harshest measures against Malta that is just shy of declaring a formal war against us. Decades of these raids against us has given us knowledge on how to combat these raiding vessels out at sea whilst also training sailors and admirals in Malta for upcoming naval campaigns."
 vespers_linger_in_our_memory: "Remember the War of the Sicilian Vespers"
 vespers_linger_in_our_memory_desc: "Though Malta played a minor role in it, the War of Sicilian Vespers in the late 1200s made quite an impact on Maltese history. Though those circumstances that led to the war will never happen again, we can at least work to provoke similar incidents in places near Malta so that we can get involved and possibly enforce some of our 'ancestral' claims."
 defensive_dedication: "Righteous Defense"
 defensive_dedication_desc: "Despite what foreign states would have in store for us, Malta has managed to remain a bastion of freedom for itself. Iberian influences, Italian interests, and even North African incursions have not stopped us from building up our islands to where we are now, and what has helped us most in this independent time period (besides our navy) has been our stalwart fortifications. Compounding upon existing defenses and fortifying our islands even more is of the utmost importance to Maltese people as defense is the way by which we survive."
 language_distinct_from_others: "The Maltese Language"
 language_distinct_from_others_desc: "Unique to other languages near us due to its influences from Arabic and other sources other than Latin, the Maltese language is part of what makes us a true sight to behold. We can call ourselves Christian or Muslim at various points, but what we can't call ourselves is Italian, Iberian, or Arabian; we are Maltese, a true pearl in the heart of the Mediterranean Sea."

 kingdom_of_candia: "'Kingdom of Candia'"
 kingdom_of_candia_desc: "Under the rule of the Venetians, our land was known as the 'Kingdom of Candia' and was a staging ground for projecting Venetian influence outward toward the Aegean Sea. Though those days of Venetian dominance are gone, we still remember how strong of a naval presence they had around our island through both their fleets for combat and their fleets for trade. Crete should thoroughly aspire to be like Venice in this sense so that it too can project its naval presence outward."
 memory_of_the_revolt_of_st_titus: "The Revolt of St. Titus and More"
 memory_of_the_revolt_of_st_titus_desc: "The Venetian authority over Crete was not concrete and uniform in the past; Cretan people have had a long history of revolting against Venetian authority to assert the autonomy of Crete as a whole. Perhaps the largest revolt of these was the Revoly of St. Titus that happened from 1363 to 1368. Though the efforts of the rebels were not realized as Venice regained control eventually, they strived to create the 'Republic of Saint Titus' for all of Crete, an idea which has lasted to this very day. In memory and in the honor of those fellow Cretans that have fallen in battle to sustain Cretan autonomy, we carry forth in our righteous journey."
 exposure_to_foreign_innovations: "Exposed to Foreign Ideas"
 exposure_to_foreign_innovations_desc: "Venice was not completely bad in what it did for Crete and its people, we must admit that. In their time ruling over us, they exposed the Cretan people to a number of innovations and ideas that had their start in the various cities of the Italian Peninsula. This spreading of ideas and technologies must be cultivated if Crete is to proceed on as true state of its own, for learning about what others have come up with and integrating it into Crete itself is vital for staying afloat on the political scene."
 natural_defenses_of_crete: "Even the Hills have Weapons?!"
 natural_defenses_of_crete_desc: "Our island is not the most welcoming place for invaders to land on, no? Hills and rugged terrain all across the island make invading our homeland something of a Herculean task since not only do we have the terrain to back us up, we also have partisans from all across Crete ready to do battle with enemy invaders. The defensive nature of Crete will make invaders say to themselves, 'Even the hills have weapons?!' and we will laugh as we beat them back again and again."
 genoese_and_venetian_naval_legacy: "Refine the Cretan Navy"
 genoese_and_venetian_naval_legacy_desc: "Genoa and Venice fought for quite a long time for influence on Crete in the past, and even though Venice won out in the end, we still have a distinct maritime legacy in us that stems from both. In order for Crete to hold its own in wars across the Mediterranean Sea, it needs to have a stronger navy with more sailors at the ready; building docks and shipyards across Crete's coastline is the first step in this process."
 hostile_to_foreign_intruders: "Defensive Expertise of Cretans"
 hostile_to_foreign_intruders_desc: "Cretans are nothing if not resourceful when it comes to devising a defensive strategy; even our peasants know how to defend their local areas with anything from crossbows and swords to outdated gunpowder weapons. Not only this, but working in tandem with the rugged terrain makes it so that fortificatiokns built from stone are less needed. Cretan fortifications though, are some of the best ones across Europe and this is largely due in part to partisans being able to supply and assist the garrisoned defenders."
 trade_viability_empowered: "The New Trade Hub"
 trade_viability_empowered_desc:  "As Crete prospers, so does trade across the Aegean Sea and in nearby trade nodes. We cannot say exactly how profitable things will become in the future, but we can see to a fair degree that Crete itself will become a strong hub for merchants in the future. Perhaps in time, we can succeed where Venice left off in terms of trade dominance."

Saint Liborius, the second bishop of Le Mans, is revered by those of Paderborn for his patronage against certain ailments of the human body. Let his blessing shine down upon the ones who lead Paderborn, and the ones who serve the Prince-Bishopric from the ground up."
 the_river_pader: "The River Pader"
 the_river_pader_desc: "Though perhaps not a great river like the Rhine River, the river Pader is where we call home and it helps give us a slight bit of range with regards to our actions alongside productive potential within our farms and estates. Paderborn may not be the strongest state in terms of food production or trade income, but having a slight focus on these sectors through our home river can help things out."
 both_religious_and_secular_responsibilities: "Two Realms of Authority"
 both_religious_and_secular_responsibilities_desc: "The one who leads Paderborn is entrusted not only with religious authority, but also with secular authority. It is a daunting task for many since it requires an intelligent and careful mind that is also oriented toward heaven above, but Paderborn rulers have shown that they are capable of taming both realms of authority within Paderborn itself."
 lessons_from_dietrich_iii: "Lessons from Dietrich III"
 lessons_from_dietrich_iii_desc: "Dietrich III of Moers was a costly figure within Paderborn as he led wars against a variety of other small states that included Soest and its bishop. His wars put Paderborn into a great amount of debt, necessitating financial restructuring and a shift in how economics played out in Paderborn itself. It is from his costly mistakes that we will learn from so that we are not lured into ruinous wars that devastate our economy."
 reformers_to_our_right_and_left: "Religious Reformers of Paderborn"
 reformers_to_our_right_and_left_desc: "With the Protestant Reformation in full swing all across Europe, Paderborn has had its own share of reformers wanting to change the very nature of Paderborn's administration. We are hesitant to just let these reformers do as they please, but we cannot deny that some suggestions they bring forth are valid ways of improving Paderborn as a whole. Perhaps we can work with them and tolerate these heretics for the greater good?"
 mediate_hostilities_between_the_faithful: "Uphold Religious Toleration"
 mediate_hostilities_between_the_faithful_desc: "Be they Protestant, Calvinist, Baptist, Lutheran, or even Jesuit in religious conviction, Paderborn has come to welcome them all over time thanks to the fact that we have had strong influences from both religious sides. Enforcing a more tolerant view on religion throughout Paderborn is what will ultimately lead to it being a successful religious state in these troubling times."

 dethrone_surrounding_ecclesiastic_powers_desc: "We have shown time and time again how pious we are and how strong our policies are toward empowering all those of various Christian denominations inside Paderborn, yet still other bishoprics and princes around Paderborn seek to dethrone us from our rightful position of ecclesiastic authority. We must not stand by as these challenges to our authority are levied from year to year and decade to decade, no, we must fight to the bitter end and uphold the authority that Paderborn has."

 lippe_feuds_desc: "Are we blessed by these feuds, or cursed by them? There are people who argue for both sides, but the leaders of Lippe hold firm to the latter due to the fact that capitalizing on these feuds and winning them could lead to serious territorial expansion alongside increased influence. This is a long way off though, and for now we must be content with working the fields of battle with our soldiers to enforce the claims of Lippe."
 raise_the_status_of_lippe: "Rising Higher and Higher"
 raise_the_status_of_lippe_desc: "Lippe is not just a singular town as some outsiders might think, but rather it is a collection of towns that form a state that is greater than the normal sum of its parts. Further developing these towns upward through promoting infrastructure like roads, libraries, and markets will help bolster Lippe's economic status greatly."
 what_belongs_to_lippe: "What Belongs to Lippe"
 what_belongs_to_lippe_desc: "The feuds of the past ensure that Lippe will have no shortage of expansion paths; our dynastic claims alongside the various diplomatic webs we are in help make this a reality. Thus, when we annex new territory through war, others around us will know that we are justified in our actions and those of Vienna, Prague, Munich, and other prominent places will have nothing to fear from our expansion."
 fortify_lippe_towns: "Protect our Belongings"
 fortify_lippe_towns_desc: "As we build upward and expand outward, Lippe is going to need stronger garrisons is it not? Strengthening the defensive structures we have and building more castles belonging to our royal dynasty is exactly what will help hold our realm together, especially if armies from Bohemia, Austria, or some other place come marching through to curb our momentum."
 shifting_back_and_forth_with_diplomacy: "Shifts in the Shadows"
 shifting_back_and_forth_with_diplomacy_desc: "It is partially thanks to our deals and practices with regards to diplomacy that Lippe is as influential as it is. The diplomatic landscape of Europe is unceasing in when and how it changes, thus Lippe needs to hold itself to the various deals it is promised over time so that it can still act accordingly. To help with this, formalizing our diplomacy with a secure office of sorts in the administration will do just the job."
 adopting_church_ordinance: "The Church Ordinance of Lippe"
 adopting_church_ordinance_desc: "The Protestant Reformation has given birth to a number of issues in Lippe that we otherwise would not have had, yet still we find that we can grow from the fires of this religious fracturing of the Catholic faith. Lippe, though somewhat divided on whether or not it desires to follow one path or another, is primed to adopt what is called a 'church ordinance' by some. Through this sort of religious constitution, we can uphold stability and peace internally throughout Lippe, at least for the time being."
 relations_with_surrounding_powers: "Tinder for the Fires"
 relations_with_surrounding_powers_desc: "We have been a subject to other states and independent at other times, meaning our connections go far throughout the Holy Roman Empire. Whilst we sustain ourselves on diplomacy and keen administrative practices, we must always be aware of the fact that we have mercenary contracts open to us in the way that others do not. Feuds and shady connections have their advantages, if you can survive to see the end of the former and utilize the latter."

Though the cathedral chapter may have its power on the rise, more secular authorities are seeing to it that the politics and regular administrative matters of Osnabruck are handled by competent folks of educated backgrounds. Perhaps it was the clergy that was holding us back this entire time? We may find out in the future."

 rely_upon_military_servants_desc: "The knights of old are becoming a relic of the past, but still Osnabruck has a great amount of influence from prominent military leaders and officials since they carry out the defense and offense of our land. Whilst we should not try to unduly cut these officials from power, we should be wary of what influence they have in our government even if they provide inherent benefits to us during times of war."
 war_profits_in_osnabruck: "Profits lead to Influence"
 war_profits_in_osnabruck_desc: "Osnabruck's various fueds across state lines are taxing upon the local populace, but for merchants seeking new chances at making a profit, they're actually rather intriguing opportunities. Mercenary contracts offered to us are often helped out by the fact that our merchant class is willing to take these daring attempts at making a profit during times of war, so why shouldn't we use these contracts?"
 religious_mess_that_is_osnabruck: "A Religious Mess"
 religious_mess_that_is_osnabruck_desc: "With the rise of Protestanism and its various offshoots, Osnabruck is a mess with religious communities striving to have ultimate influence over the land. These disputes are often violent in nature and we can't seem to have a solid solution with favoring one side or another. It won't be a pretty ending for at least some of the people who choose a different faith than what is decided by the administration of Osnabruck."
 religious_orders_called_in: "Call Upon Holy Orders"
 religious_orders_called_in_desc: "From the Jesuits to the Augustinians, Osnabruck has been the place where a variety of these holy orders come to settle down in so that they can cultivate their influence and add to their ranks. Whilst we will refuse their influence in our daily politics, we can at least work with them on recruiting new missionaries that serve both these holy orders and Osnabruck itself."
 theological_insights: "University of Osnabruck"
 theological_insights_desc: "Though the fires of religious reformation have blazed across Osnabruck, one good thing that has risen from the ashes has been the University of Osnabruck. It may be relatively new in comparison to others across Europe, but that does not mean it can't be a place for innovative work. Cultivating the university to be where new ideas spread around Osnabruck will be what helps our state stay in the realm of innovativness whilst also staying true to our faith."

 peaceable_governance_desc: "Through just governance and having strong religious convictions, we of Osnabruck have come to secure ourselves a stable state. Turmoil of the past be damned, we have not fallen just yet to foreign annexation and we will strive to be as independent as we possibly can.

Despite this value being seen by multiple people groups across the islands, the rivers prove to be tough to control for any one set of people including our own. No matter the cost though, we will put our troops to use and learn to overcome what defenses our enemies have put in place by these rivers; they will not hold back our state from prospering."

 mutual_defensive_alliances_in_sulawesi_desc: "The Bugi people make up a great portion of our core population, but they are not so loyal to the state as one might want. Instead they have a fair deal of autonomy and often make pacts with each other or fight over pieces of land within our own borders. The threat from the outside is becoming more and more obvious to the Bugi people inside Bone though, and we are making progress to ensure that the pacts made between our own Bugi people are kept for generations to come."

 changes_due_to_islams_presence_desc: "Islamic merchants and preachers have been spotted coming in and out of our waters, and some of them are even setting up shop on our coasts to do trade. While we welcome some of these practices and trade goods they bring with them, their beliefs and practices do clash somewhat with our own traditions. Perhaps we can learn to remedy the two with time?"

Some Malay people are here, folks from Java have settled in places, and there are even some small communities of Bugi and Batak people spread throughout. If we are to see a successful Sambas in the future, we must pull these groups together into a cohesive melding of workers in one area, administrators in another area, but perhaps most importantly, fighters for all of our land."
 fear_through_headhunting: "Headhunting!"
 fear_through_headhunting_desc: "It is a tradition as old as the Dayak people themselves: Headhunting! A gruesome and barbaric practice by some foreigners, yet it is something that instills fear in the hearts and minds of our enemies. Let those who stand against our administration know well that should they raise a sword or musket against us, they will find themselves victims of our hunters in the aftermath."

 ferocity_even_on_water_desc: "What our headhunting does for our reputation is bring a ferocious note to it, and when our sailors go forth to do battle with foreign ships, this reputation is raised up even higher thanks to just how ruthless we are on the high seas. Headhunting is not limited to just land battles, no, our fighters will do it throughout naval battles and their aftermath, meaning they are more than ready to get in close to other vessels out at sea."
 remedy_the_sea_and_land_dayaks: "Dayaks of Different Places"
 remedy_the_sea_and_land_dayaks_desc: "There are two somewhat clear distinctions of Dayak people in Sambas: 'Iban', meaning 'sea', and 'Bidayuh', meaning 'land'. Iban Dayaks live closest to the coasts, as one might expect, whilst the Bidayuh Dayaks live in the dense tropics of our mainland. The former take care of fishing, the latter take care of farming, yet both seem to have consistent feuds that make Sambas a rather volatile state at times. If we can work to connect the sea and land Dayaks closer together both culturally and economically, governing them will be easier for all of Sambas."
 primogeniture_within_the_monarchy: "Seeing how Sambas Develops"
 primogeniture_within_the_monarchy_desc: "Sambas is developing at a nice pace with communities seeing the rise of structures like tax offices, workshops, and small centers of learning. This development is helped by the fact that our administration and royal family are keen on keeping the traditional Dayak form of hierarchy in play with males taking priority over females for succession purposes. But, women are not cut out of every facet of power; Dayaks and throughout the rest of Sambas, both men and women can obtain property ownership and jostle for communal influence in that way."
 spreading_of_malay_influences: "Malay Influences in Sambas"
 spreading_of_malay_influences_desc: "We are no stranger to Malay people from the west, but it is only recently that they have begun to set up more extensive trading communities along our coastline. In doing this, they are bringing with them their religion and their traditions which are tough to handle on their own, but what we really benefit from is the expansion in trade value for Sambas. The more we trade with the Malay people it seems, the more we profit in the form of money and capable sailors."
 kaharingan_influences_upon_sambas: "Regular Islamic Contacts"
 kaharingan_influences_upon_sambas_desc: "Islamic influence in Sambas is not new by any means, but the meeting of Islam and the native religious traditions of the Dayak people (called 'Kaharingan') has been rather interesting to say the least. Though Kaharingan is seen as a form of Hinduism by outsiders, to us it is a very core part of the people of Sambas as a whole; Islam's influence across those who follow Kaharingan is noticeable in that it is melding with these traditions in a variety of ways. If we can stoke this intermingling of ideas instead of potential religious conflict, Sambas might be able to have Islam and Kaharingan live side-by-side in peace."

 simple_khans_no_more_desc: "And as we ride off into the vast steppe of our homeland, blood dripping off of us and sweat coming down our forehead, we look to the lands of our ancestors. They seem almost unchanging, no? But that is simply not the whole story, not anymore at least. The land is beginning to change just as we Khorchin Mongols are changing with time. The land is slowly being developed more and more in key places, just like how our administration is evolving more and more to meet the needs of its own people."

 compete_around_nahan: "Nahan Competition"
 compete_around_nahan_desc: "The beginning of Sirmur's history is a bit murky to say the least, but oral tradition tells us of the tumultuous history Nahan had as the predecessor state to Sirmur. Despite what it struggled with, Nahan flourished over time and imparted onto us a legacy of local conquest in these mountains and highlands around us. These harsh lands are ruthless in terms of political movements as it is, so we would be wise to keep in mind the warlike mentality of our ancestors."
 to_learn_when_we_aid_others: "We Send Aid and Observers"
 to_learn_when_we_aid_others_desc: "Though we have not been able to exert our power outward like other states in the south have, we have been able to send aid and observers outside of Sirmur to help in foreign conflicts. Sometimes Sirmur even sees subjugation by others, but we must not see this subjugation as a pure loss in competence for us. It is rather an opportunity for Sirmur to grow even more, just in a different direction! Sending aid to an overlord and observers to learn how they conquer, move in battle, and conduct administrative practices is exactly what Sirmur should be doing."
 how_to_farm_in_the_mountains: "Sprouting from just a Rock"
 how_to_farm_in_the_mountains_desc: "Many in the south think that places like Sirmur are just rocky wastelands with very little in the way of agricultural potential, but these shallow people are deluded in their thinking. Sirmur has plenty of farming potential, we just need the funding and the tools to get the ground ready and the people settled in place. Now that Sirmur is getting on its feet in both previously mentioned aspects, we can start to focus on the agricultural sector and improve our overall grain stores."
 what_the_sikhs_teach_us: "Sikh Influences in Sirmur"
 what_the_sikhs_teach_us_desc: "Sikhism is something that is relatively new in terms of religious movements, but it is not without its followers that are becoming somewhat influential in Sirmur. Our proximity to the homeland of the Punjabi people and the epicenter of the Sikh faith means that sometimes we do get refugees of Sikh affiliation, meaning we need to contend with some serious religious differences in our own land. Sirmur is by no means in a state ready to stoke religious tensions, so we will be striving for mutual understanding with the Sikh people in our own land."
 chains_of_sirmur_command: "Chains to the Administration"
 chains_of_sirmur_command_desc: "Sirmur has traditionally been a somewhat decentralized state due to the mountains we find our heart of power inside of, but developments over the past few generations has led to our power increasing, our revenue growing, and our knowledge of administrative practices increasing. It is with all of these factors combined that we will enforce the chains of command more than ever, extracting our dues fairly and justly from our subjects as the months go by."
 transition_the_fiefs_of_sirmur: "Higher Level Practices in Sirmur"
 transition_the_fiefs_of_sirmur_desc: "For far too long Sirmur has relied on people of royal blood that may or may not be loyal to the administration. Whether it is a raja, maharaja, emir, or sultan at the head of the Sirmur state, the loyalty to them must be ensured so that defenses are not compromised and the state itself is growing instead of shrinking. Slowly replacing these noble fiefs with people more loyal to the administration (such as members of the royal family) will be the next step to improving our state as a whole."
 the_usage_of_the_kukri: "The Kukri!"
 the_usage_of_the_kukri_desc: "Used for centuries in our home region of Nepal and outside of it, the kukri is a deceptively simple weapon that is more commonly thought of as a farming tool. And yet, it is this weapon that our military use regularly for hand-to-hand combat (alongside any martial arts that are known to them) with devastating success. Especially in the tight mountain passes where armies may encounter each other more suddenly, the kukri has become a tool that both experienced and new soldiers trust to get them through close quarters combat. Going forth, having it be a standard training weapon will serve to instill a great degree of strength in our soldiers."

 kurma_second_avatar_of_vishnu: "Second Avatar of Vishnu"
 kurma_second_avatar_of_vishnu_desc: "Our name stems from the Sanskrit word 'Kurma' meaning 'Tortoise' or 'Turtle, and it is also synonomous with the second avatar of Vishnu. Though Kumaon has had a long history full of highs and lows, remembering the foundation of it all through the very name of the state itself should give us proper direction. Let us harden our defenses, pick the best points for defending our land, and ensure that any invader that dares intrude on Kumaon soil regrets every step they take!"
 shifting_capital_cities_around: "From Place to Place"
 shifting_capital_cities_around_desc: "In our own history, the capital has shifted within the general vicinity we would normally call 'Kumaon'. From being at first in Bajinath to then going to Champawat later on, the transitions have been gradual but significant enough for our people to remember them to this very day because moving such supplies and resources to a new location is pivotal. If we can channel this will again in the future for new building projects and when we need to perhaps relocate some signficant structures, we will be able to take serious advantage of the terrain inside our borders."
 dedication_through_bagnath_temple: "Temples Galore in Kumaon"
 dedication_through_bagnath_temple_desc: "Throughout the generations, devotion to the deities has been central to Kumaon and the people that have lived and died inside its borders. The temples we house from our ancestors and the temples we construct today are all to the glory of the deities above and serve as open displays of our own piety no matter what happens to the administration or the royal family. Bagnath Temple, Baleshwar Temple, Nagnath Temple, all of them and the ones we build up in the future will be marvels to any outsider that steps foot into our land."
 repeated_himalayan_wars: "Fighting in Thin Air"
 repeated_himalayan_wars_desc: "Piety does not beget peace, however, and it is in times of war that Kumaon must show it has the will and the power to survive. Luckily we have plenty of experience fighting in these higher reaches so we are much more versed in how to get through stone fortifications whilst keeping our own regiments supplied with resources."
 highlanders_versus_lowlanders: "Fighting in the Heat"
 highlanders_versus_lowlanders_desc: "We must tend to our tactics and strategies when dealing with fighting at lower altitudes though since the politics to our south are anything but stable. Whether it is the Delhi Sultanate, militant Rohillas, or some other group invading and conquering territories, Kumaon fighters need to be able to put up a strong defense and offense when push comes to shove against us."
 reconcile_on_religious_grounds: "Seeing Eye to Eye"
 reconcile_on_religious_grounds_desc: "At the end of it all, we still refrain from justifying our conflicts through theology of any kind. Some zealous people of Kumaon detest this but we see no reason to engage in this religious warfare that others around us think is righteous. Instead we would rather reconcile on religious grounds so as to have fewer issues when it comes to governance and unrest."

 linked_to_kuamon_desc: "After the Katyuri Dynasty of ages past fell, Kumaon rose up in prominence and has held sway around this area for many generations. Though their power is waning somewhat, we cannot deny our links both culturally and politically to Kumaon; embracing this link to them could perhaps grant us an easier time taking what land they of Kumaon have claims to."
 seven_children_of_the_katyuri_kingdom: "Eight Princely States Remained"
 seven_children_of_the_katyuri_kingdom_desc: "Once the old Katyuri Dynasty fell from grace, there were eight princely states that were left in the ashes: Kumaon, Doti, Baijnath-Katuri, Dwarahat, Baramandal, Askot, Sira, Sora, and Kali Kumaon. As things progressed, Doti and Kumaon remained as the only two serious forces that could live up to the legacy of the past and it is this claim to the old throne of the Katyuri Dynasty that we are known for. There is respect to be had for living within the bounds of this legacy, that much is certain."
 surpass_kuamon_in_importance: "Rivalry with Kumaon"
 surpass_kuamon_in_importance_desc: "Whilst we respect Kumaon to a degree in regards to politics and diplomacy, we cannot stand by and let them continue to usurp the power that rightfully belongs to Doti instead. The rulers of Kumaon have proven time and again that they cannot handle the chains of power effectively and that their subjects run wild without proper orders. Soon enough we will have our chance at showing Kumaon and others just how much we can live up the legacy of the Katyuri Dynasty, we just have to bide our time."
 usage_of_the_kali_and_karnali_rivers: "Kali and Karnali River Usage"
 usage_of_the_kali_and_karnali_rivers_desc: "The name 'Doti' stems from the older term 'doab' which generally means the land between two rivers. As geography would have it, the Kali and Karnali Rivers are just such two rivers that feed the heart of our state and its capital, meaning that if we are focused enough, we can certainly make these mountains and highlands bloom with crops and productivity."
 rise_of_the_dotiyali_and_kumauni_languages: "Dotiyali and Kumauni Languages"
 rise_of_the_dotiyali_and_kumauni_languages_desc: "The languages of these lands, Dotiyali and Kumauni, are not as prominent as other languages like Sanskrit or Persian, but our common people speak both Dotiyali and Kumauni more so than they do other foreign languages. Promoting our own languages through the writing of manuscripts and books whilst also using it for regular court functions will allow us to become a much more distinct polity in the region, one that refuses to be taken over by foreign influence."
 hindu_festivals_within_doti: "Embrace the Festivals"
 hindu_festivals_within_doti_desc: "And as we continue to grow and blossom through the ages with mountains around us and innovations streaming in, our people dance and sing in the great many festivals held every year around Doti. They have their own distinct flavor thanks to being conducted in the mountains for so long, but they are still festivals that solidify our foundation amongst the people. No royal is too good to go to a Holi festival, and no worker is too unworthy to attend Harela!"

 remember_the_khasa_kingdom_desc: "Prior to Jumla being an independent entity, the Khasa Kingdom reigned in its place and stretched over a considerable distance in the hills and highlands. When it collapsed, Jumla was left to fight amongst the other polities for dominance in the land, yet the legacy left by the Khasa Kingdom still shines brightly to this day. Let us embody that legacy going forward and continue to proclaim ourselves as its successor as we triumph into the future."
 skirmishes_in_the_mountains_of_nepal: "Skirmishes by the Roof of the world"
 skirmishes_in_the_mountains_of_nepal_desc: "Our soldiers fight rough battles that are shallow in numbers compared to the battles in the south near the Ganges River, but near the roof of the world, there isn't much room to throw tens of thousands of soldiers into the fray. That is why we (and many others) have learned to skirmish with smaller numbers of troops so that there is less of a concern about supply routes and armies being too big to coordinate effectively."
 emulate_our_rajput_relatives: "Emulation of the Rajputs"
 emulate_our_rajput_relatives_desc: "Some find it as a tenuous connection, but part of our original royal family is somewhat connected to the Rajput clans in the south near Chittor and Mewar. Whilst we of Jumla are far from being true Rajput warriors and nobles, we can emulate some of their martial prowess by emphasizing stricter training methods and a more well educated set of commanders. We won't be using cavalry like they do for obvious reasons but we can most certainly put our focus on the standing soldiers of Jumla."
 never_forget_the_baise_rajya_era: "Lessons of the Baise Rajya"
 never_forget_the_baise_rajya_era_desc: "What came directly after the collapse of the Khasa Kingdom is known as 'Baise Rajya' or, individual polities that were sovereign in their own right for a short time and ruled by Khas. There are still some around to this day, Jumla being one of them, but that collapse into decentralized unrest and disorder instilled harsh lessons into the ruling family of Jumla. Lessons on keeping the peace, maintaining authority, and sustaining a proper military for the state are all included so as to keep the entirety of the state itself stable."
 in_fighting_we_lead_from_the_front: "Lead from the Front!"
 in_fighting_we_lead_from_the_front_desc: "There are some that think the ruler of Jumla should stay back in the capital when conflict breaks out so as to not risk getting captured or hurt, but what good is the ruler going to do the soldiers if they are in the capital and delegating all authority to military officials? Jumla needs the ruler to be ready and able to lead from the front with the men of the army! It is dangerous, true, but it is also inspiring to see that the one who rules Jumla is ready and willing to suffer the ravages of battle alongside a mere recruit or officer."
 learning_flexibility_in_combat: "Teaching in Defeat and Victory"
 learning_flexibility_in_combat_desc: "In Jumla's experience, fighting in the high elevations of our home has been harrowing and rough over the generations, but it has taught each generation many things that may or may not carry over to the next generation. Now that writing and printing are becoming more of a realiy all around us, it is time that we make those teachings from past generations put into solid manuscripts and tomes ready for future generations to learn from and critique. The more we can master fighting in these perilous conditions, the better off we will be when we must face the strong states in the south."

 tharu_people_heartland_desc: "We, the Tharu people, have been in this region for countless generations, cultivating the land and taking care of ourselves as politics around us shifted and swayed. Despite whatever happens on the outside, we have retained much of our traditions from previous generations unlike other people groups around us; we have not given up what our ancestors cultivated and we are not about to let outsiders breach and break down what magnificent customs we have built up so far."
 reistance_to_malaria: "Resistant to Malaria"
 reistance_to_malaria_desc: "Disease is a constant threat to any community of any size. Whether it is the Black Death or consumption or even malaria, any and all disease can spell disaster for a community if it spreads enough and instills panic and chaos. Yet the Tharu people have been seemingly gifted with an inherent gift: resistance to malaria! It is not in every single Tharu person, yes, but many people of Tharu descent are noticeably resistant to this terrible disease that plagues our region and nearby ones. It is through this resistance that we can better cultivate a stronger state for the Tharu people."
 tharu_people_are_of_the_forest: "We of the Forest"
 tharu_people_are_of_the_forest_desc: "We are not mountainous people to the same degree as nearby people groups in our region are; the Himalayas are vast in how many people they contain, but the Tharu people straddle that edge between the mountains and the lower regions. Thus, we are and have been seen as people of the forest for a great many generations now, practicing farming, hunting, and gathering to a much greater degree than our mountainous cousins. Being of the forest will help garner us easier methods of production of resources for all sorts of means like warfare and trade."
 reaching_the_other_tharu_languages: "Tharu Languages, United"
 reaching_the_other_tharu_languages_desc: "Our language is quite distinct from others, yes, but it isn't a unified language either. There are several 'versions' of the Tharu language spread throughout yet they are all somewhat intelligible to each other. If we can unite these various Tharu groups into our own state and sort out the differences, we will be able to handle politics from the top down to a much greater degree."
 promote_the_badghar_system_locally: "The Badghar System"
 promote_the_badghar_system_locally_desc: "The 'Badghar System' is a system of local governance used by the Tharu people where a a group of villages elect a single badghar as chief for a year; the election takes place usually in January or February after the Maghi Festival. This elected governance at the local level helps keep the balance of power in check and would greatly help us in extending our reach to more local communities where we need to collect taxes and recruits from, so why not try to implement across our nation?"
 retain_our_own_traits: "The Tharu People Remember"
 retain_our_own_traits_desc: "The Tharu people are perhaps one of the few groups of people least influenced by Hinduism as a whole, but we cannot deny that over time Hindu traditions have played some role in shaping Tharu society and culture. Still, our people remember and perform the religious and cultural practices that are distinctly not Hindu in origin, meaning that we are quite proud of our independent cultural past. As we go forth, we will continue to keep these customs with despite what outside influence we come across."

 eight_rivers_in_kathmandu_desc: "Our capital city is filled with rivers, eight of them to be exact, all of which originate in the high mountains nearby. They provide ready amounts of water for irrigation and our citizens so that they may grow despite the rough political conditions around them. We are not blessed with a great amount of land to use like those of Delhi or Dhaka get, but we can certainly make use with what we have available."
 rife_with_growth: "Rapid Growth to be Tamed"
 rife_with_growth_desc: "Our ambitious growth in population size and infrastructure has led to a number of ideas and innovations spreading through Kathmandu, but these growths must be tamed and regulated so as to not cause friction between the common folk and the administration of Kathmandu. Compromises will be made, agreements will be signed, and Kathmandu will see the steady rise in power it has always been destined for despite the troubles of the past."
 designed_to_be_like_chandrahrasa: "Designed like the Chandrahas"
 designed_to_be_like_chandrahrasa_desc: "Within the Hindu epic 'Ramayana', the indestructible sword given by Lord Shiva to Ravana is called 'Chandrahas'. It is this very sword that the founders of our city based its shape on centuries ago, and even though its growth has been somewhat hard to maintain throughout the centuries, we have come very far in cultivating the city of 'Chandrahas'. The city and its people will strive to emulate the powerful indestructible sword of the Ramayana epic both in their day to day lives and when defending the very land they stand on from invaders."
 revive_the_eight_barracks_of_kathmandu: "The Eight Barracks of Kathmandu"
 revive_the_eight_barracks_of_kathmandu_desc: "In the times of the old Licchavis, Kathmandu was surrounded by eight barracks protected by 'Ajimas', goddesses from our pantheon of deities exclusive to Kathmandu and nearby areas. Though much has changed since the time of the Licchavis (such as their architecture being destroyed by earthquakes), we find ourselves still in need of these barracks at the edge of our city to provide us with a sense of security and militancy. Rebuilding them for our people and for our own protection will undoubtedly help spur more people to join up into the ranks of Kathmandu's military."
 contacts_with_tibetan_buddhism: "Converse with Tibetans Again"
 contacts_with_tibetan_buddhism_desc: "In the past, Kathmandu was a major trade hub and transit site between the Indian subcontinent and Tibet as a whole, so much so that Bhrikuti (from our region) married the Tibetan monarch named Songtsan Gampo. This marriage from back then helped bring Tibetan Buddhism into our region of the Himalayas, promoting religious dialogue and the diffusion of cultural and religious traditions throughout all regions nearby Kathmandu. Perhaps it is time we reach out to the Tibetan people? Perhaps it is time that Kathmandu becomes another trade hub and center of diffusion of cultural ideas."
 ready_to_rebuild_kathmandu_again: "You'll Never Keep Me Down!"
 ready_to_rebuild_kathmandu_again_desc: "Kathmandu has seen destruction in previous eras thanks to nature itself, not just by the hands of devious enemies. Earthquakes are known to cause great destruction across our region and Kathmandu has felt the wrath of them in full, especially when a large earthquake destroyed much of the architecture from the Licchavi era, thus forcing the people to rebuild in the midst of terrible hardship. These experiences have hardened those Kathmandu and made its inhabitants ready for whatever nature may through at it; you can knock its people down to the ground, but you will never keep them down."

Though it prospered for some time, it eventually collapsed in on itself and left a variety of claimants struggling to reclaim that lost glory. Makwanpur is one such claimant and one that has proven itself worthy enough to stand the test of time so far. It is our duty going forth to enforce our inherited claims across the region through diplomatic efforts or military conquest."

 compete_against_gorkha_desc: "Gorkha as well as other small polities around us put pressure on the political scene in the region, do they not? All of us moving back and forth, struggling to gain an edge over each other in the face of neighboring states that could seek to conquer us from the south or north; truly it is a daunting task to be where Makwanpur is. It is this precarious position, though, that allows us to train our regiments in a more skilled fashion since we can test out what works and what does not work against our neighbors. We just need to be careful we don't make one too many mistakes..."

 buddhist_tidings_across_makwanpur_desc: "Though we are mostly Hindu in our alignment, there are some Muslims and Buddhists scattered throughout Makwanpur. The legacy of the latter is even larger in Makwanpur than in other states, interestingly enough, as one of the Khasa rulers left an in scription on the Ashoka pillar with a six-syllable mantra: 'Om mani padme hum (May Prince Ripu Malla be long victorious)'. This connection to Buddhism, albeit not the strongest one there could be, should be revived and looked into throughout Makwanpur, for the theological and philosophical dialogue that could be had would certainly give innovative life to our land."
 clouded_history_of_the_region: "Shrouded in Countless Claims"
 clouded_history_of_the_region_desc: "Makwanpur as well as the other petty states of the region are left in a sea of various claims around the region. Some say they deserve this land or that land, others try to buy the lands they want if they have enough money; some of Makwanpur's own rulers have tried both and there is no shame in that. All of this is part of the 'sorting process' our region must go through in order to see which state is capable of rising to the challenge. We are here to ensure that the one that can do as such is Makwanpur."

 chaubisi_and_baise_rajya_desc: "After the Khasa Kingdom collapsed, what it left behind were known as 'Chaubisi Rajya' and 'Baise Rajya', numerous petty states that have since fought for dominance of the region with little success over the generations. Makwanpur is of course among these petty states but we have been keen on learning how to integrate others into our state as we go on; sometimes we just need to be more forceful with our diplomacy since not all in the region are ready to recognize the prominence of Makwanpur."
 hardened_through_the_generations: "The Hardened of Makwanpur"
 hardened_through_the_generations_desc: "The road to get where we are has not been easy at any level. Citizens endured harsh times, the military fought to their dying breath at various points, religious adherents suffered greatly in certain conflicts, and our administration has been strained under the pressures of internal and external forces. Yet all of this has brought more and more life into Makwanpur as we can and have been learning how to deal with these issues as they wash over our state. Makwanpur is never one to be stagnant, not when the regions around us are so volatile and when our own home area is besieged by internal conflicts and external influences."

 land_of_the_drukpa_subsect_desc: "Buddhism within Tibet has had an interesting history to say the least, and Bhutan is part of that history too as a land on the edge of Tibetan religious politics. The growing tensions with rival schools in Tibetan lands has led to a plethora of so-called Red Hat Sect members (otherwise known as followers of the Kagyu School) fleeing to Bhutan, meaning our religious politics are being colored greatly by the Kagyu School itself. Most important among these that our people and administration have embraced over the generations is the 'Drukpa Kagyu' subsect, and it is a subsect that can truly embody Bhutan as a whole."

 becoming_the_zhabdrung_of_bhutan_desc: "What we need going forward for all of Bhutan to stay unified under is, well, a leader of course. For far too long we have been struggling to maintain political cohesion due to Tibetan influences spilling over into our lands, but we must take a stand! We must turn back these influences at once! Bhutan needs not the guidance from an authority in Lhasa or in the Kham region, no, Bhutan will be led by a true Zhabdrung ('At Whose Feet One Submits')! Through their spiritual and political authority we will have peace and the people of Bhutan will follow them instead of some far off figure."

 resisting_tibetan_invasions_desc: "And yet, even as we proclaim ourselves a Zhabdrung and reform our own administration over time, various states surrounding Bhutan seek to influence its politics and its people, thinking that such a small slice of land cannot really be a threat to them. These notions are far from correct and we will show them just how wrong they are when they come to strike us down; Bhutan will fight to the bitter end!"
 ordered_theocratic_matters: "Unhindered Theocratic Matters"
 ordered_theocratic_matters_desc: "In continuing our development, the theocratic nature of our administration does not mean the Zhabdrung has sole authority over anything and everything. There is a Druk Desi (regent) elected on a three-year term, a state council that includes regional rulers from various dzongs, and even a Je Khenp (lord abbot) that is elected from a state monastic body. In laying this all out for the future and strengthening these positions of government so they do not fall out of relevance or to political intrigue, Bhutan can maintain its own integrity despite however outside politics shift around."

 by_tsa_yig_do_we_operate_desc: "Tsa Yig is really any monastic constitution/code that is codified based on Tibetan Buddhist precepts. Whilst usually every monastery has its own variation of Tsa Yig found within, Bhutan itself should be governed by it as well to keep in line with how our administration functions. In doing so, we should also be ready to adjust certain parts of the code as Bhutan comes across various new ideas and innovations, meaning that the code is not something that is rigid for all Zhabdrungs of Bhutan."

 exclaves_or_just_friends_of_bhutan_desc: "When the several members of the Kagyu School fled Tibetan lands to find homes in other places, Bhutan was one of them and it is here that they found a great deal of influence. But it is not only in Bhutan that Kagyu members spread their teachings and influence, for in fact other places surrounding the Tibetan region have small yet prominent communities of Tibetan Buddhists that follow some form of the old Kagyu School. Reaching out to them and improving relations with them will earn us a great deal of respect in the future."

What we know for certain, however, is that Sikkim has always and continues to have strong ties to Tibet as a whole, whether it be on religious, diplomatic, or even economic grounds. Utilizing these ties to better support our capital and its royal court will undoubtedly bolster Sikkim's prominence."

Mostly we sit on the side, waiting to hear and see what news comes through regarding the changes in regards to religious schools and their political influence. Often times after we get this news, we receive an influx of religious refugees and it is through them that we are learning to be much more cooperative and understanding of our fellow religious traditions."

 nepali_but_tibetan_too_desc: "Sikkim, much like the other small states around it, is a state that is caught in between regions: the Indian subcontinent to the south and Tibet to the north. It is hard to carve out a living in these highlands and mountainous areas, but Sikkim and many others are doing so day by day. As we do so, we are providing paths to and from the previously mentioned regions, which means we are slowly becoming a center of trade and commerce in not just resources, but also in the exchange of ideas."

 tibetan_style_administration_desc: "The strong influences from Tibet has meant that our government structure is very much in the style of traditionally Tibetan states. Dzongs are a regular feature in Sikkim and they serve as administrative centers and great defensive measures against any and all that try to invade Sikkim. Continuing down this path of Tibetan governance should only serve to cement our footprint within the region, culminating in a wondrous and safe Sikkim state."
 sikkim_tribes_to_become_integrated: "Recognition of Sikkim's Tribes"
 sikkim_tribes_to_become_integrated_desc: "There are a great variety of tribes scattered throughout Sikkim and they cannot all be put under lock-and-key because of, well, the natural terrain and environment of Sikkim. Instead of trying to routinely enforce strict laws on them through our dzongs, we should come to understandings with the tribes and give them some degree of autonomy so that they can work the land as they have for centuries. If we can cooperate with the tribes and integrate them properly, we will certainly have a fresh pool of loyal people ready to defend Sikkim no matter what happens."

 won_by_the_strength_of_the_bow_and_arrow_desc: "Our name was decided long ago during the era of Ten Limbu Kings, and it means roughly, 'acquired by the bow': Li = Bow; ambu = acquire. Despite all that has happened since this era of divided states within Limbuwan, our people still hold the distinction in the name up high, for it is by the bow and arrow that we will triumph and prosper. Even when new weapons come to the doorstep of Limbuwan, the bow and arrow will remain a timeless weapon for our men to train and hunt with."
 festival_toward_yuma_sammang: "Yuma Sammang of Limbuwan"
 festival_toward_yuma_sammang_desc: "Goddess of our people for countless generations now, Yuma Sammang, is worshipped in almost all of Limbuwan's heartland despite Hindu traditions becoming more and more prominent. The fesitval in her honor that is held every three years still draws in many people from across our territory and it helps cultivate a strong sense of community and identity for us in these changing times."
 keep_morang_in_check: "Keep Morang in Check"
 keep_morang_in_check_desc: "The Kingdom of Morang has been a thorn in the side of Limbuwan for decades now, but it has also been integral to the prosperity of Limbuwan as a whole. The upstart rulers from there have tried to promote their own autonomy and alliances with outsiders which undermines our own power in the capital! This cannot be allowed to continue if we are to become a cohesive state that can protect itself from outsiders, no, we must curtail Morang's growing power and centralize power in the capital as time goes on. If we have to ensure that some Morang rulers have 'accidents' that cause an untimely demise, then we will absolutely do so."
 political_exiles_cannot_hide: "Retribution Against Political Exiles"
 political_exiles_cannot_hide_desc: "And when we try to cut through the political intrigue that Morang and others heap upon Limbuwan, some think that they can escape into foreign lands of nearby states, sometimes even our rivals! The audacity of these enemies of Limbuwan is undeniable, and what is also undeniable is our resolve to seek out these political enemies and exiles no matter the cost. If it means a rival state must suffer in our conquests, then so be it! Limbuwan will not tolerate these underhanded measures by its own people!"
 cut_down_the_traitors_of_limbuwan: "Traitors in Limbuwan!"
 cut_down_the_traitors_of_limbuwan_desc: "Not even the various villages of Limbuwan are completely within our own sphere of absolute authority, for the era of Ten Limbu Kings gave each part of Limbuwan a great degree of autonomy and self-governance. Though we try to gently rein in the autonomy of these individual kingdoms in our land, some still seek to ally our rivals in the east and west, meaning that they are nothing more than traitors to Limbuwan as a whole! Exposing these heinous alliances against Limbuwan from within and cutting down the key perpetrators inside each village and town will help to show where the true authority of Limbuwan lies."
 rally_to_the_rising_cause_of_limbuwan: "Rally the People"
 rally_to_the_rising_cause_of_limbuwan_desc: "At the end of the day, when all is said and done in Limbuwan, we simply strive for peace and prosperity inside our own borders. That dream is a nice one to have but one that is often times too far to reach in its entirety, meaning that we must do what we can with what we have to keep our own land and people safe. Our struggles through thick and thin has cultivated a strong sense of unity in the core areas of Limbuwan, and it is amongst these Limbu people that we will draw our power from in the future."

 by_the_lunar_dynasty_of_gorkha_desc: "Though they may not be the leading influence in Gorkha, the Lunar Dynasty has had a great deal of influence on Gorkha's history so far. The fact that they are of the Kshatriya varna (warrior ruling caste) has also helped instill a sense of militancy within Gorkha's population, but it only added on top of the already militant nature we already possess due to the collapse of the Khasa Kingdom and the subsequent feuding states that rose up from the ashes."
 from_gorakhnath_onward: "Self-Discipline of Gorakhnath"
 from_gorakhnath_onward_desc: "Our name, Gorkha, stems from the legendary Hindu yogi saint Gorakhanth. Being one of the two notable disciples of Matsyendranath, he emphasized the search for truth in one's own life and yoga itself as a spiritual discipline that can inform a person on how to live an ethical life of self-determination. His teachings still ring clear to many in Gorkha to this day and especially those within our military as they need perhaps the most spiritual (and physical) discipline for the road ahead."
 a_domestic_market_empowered: "Look Inward for Wealth"
 a_domestic_market_empowered_desc: "Being that we are between two 'giants' that sometimes unify and crumble into pieces, Gorkha should be looking for chances to build up its own internal structure and prosperity so that it can survive independently from any power in the north or south. An internal market that can take care of itself and that can maintain some degree of structure should trading partners in either direction falter would make Gorkha far more versatile later on. Perhaps we could even start to entice foreign merchants and states to become reliant on Gorkha should things go according to plan."
 construct_economic_crises_for_neighbors: "Economic Crises are Opportunities!"
 construct_economic_crises_for_neighbors_desc: "All too often we see the fallout of economic crises in surrounding lands as well as our own, but there are somehow still winners and losers in these times of terrible sickness and starvation. As Gorkha grows internally and externally, it might be to our advantage to institute and stoke the flames of an economic crises in nearby regions so that the people from top to bottom start becoming weaker to the point where they are easier to conquer. This strategy won't make us many allies, but it will make conquests far easier since the local people are less able to resist."
 prepared_for_reprisal_attacks: "Firm Walls; Astute Defenders"
 prepared_for_reprisal_attacks_desc: "Gorkha has enemies and friends in many foreign places, but we can't rely on our allies shouldering the brunt of wars in the future; we will surely be taking invasions of our own land and we must prepare for them. Luckily our home region is mountainous, full of building materials, and full of choke points that we can utilize to halt incoming invaders before they can reach the heart of Gorkha itself. The task at hand remains though: refine our fortifications and build more of them!"
 undermining_influences_in_gorkha: "Refuse Foreign Entries"
 undermining_influences_in_gorkha_desc: "We of Gorkha are never to sure of the intentions of foreign visitors and migrants. Sure most of them seem to mean well on the surface, but religious folk and crafty merchants have done their fair share of scheming and plotting so that they may take advantage of certain aspects of the Gorkha state in one way or another. We must take measures to expel these foreign elements in Gorkha before they get out of hand and before they begin to turn out own people against us."

 founded_on_a_defensive_pretext_desc: "When our island was being invaded to the north in the late 1300s, Minister Alakesvara of the Kingdom of Gampola founded a fortress in the south to serve as a base of power and defense. As Gampola faded into history though, the fortress became a serious broker of power and influence in the region, giving rise to what we today know as Kotte. In this defensive environment that we were founded in, we must always be ready for when northern incursions start again and try to strike southward; we must give them no quarter and resist at all times!"
 enemies_of_jaffna: "Refuse the Jaffna Advance"
 enemies_of_jaffna_desc: "The Jaffna Kingdom in the north has held land on the island for too long, but they are far harder to root out than one might imagine. Ties to the Vijayanagara Empire have meant that Jaffna can grow mostly unhindered, but that isn't the case forever. We of Kotte will soon take the fight to them and after that, reverse the incursions from the north and instead return the favor!"
 notable_monks_of_kotte: "The Monks of Kotte"
 notable_monks_of_kotte_desc: "Through Kotte living out its normal life and continuing to hold out against Jaffna and its allies, the various Buddhist monks of our land have continued to make magnificent works of art and literature. We cannot stand by and just let the work be done without recognition; we instead should be upholding their work and encouraging more to be done! The traditions of our land should be relished and indulged in by all throughout, no matter how far away from the capital they are."
 arab_and_european_style_firearms: "Arab and European Trade Benefits"
 arab_and_european_style_firearms_desc: "Kotte has seen trade deals from places such as Sumatra, East Africa, and even Arabia, but this should not be a shock to anyone. Even firearms from Arab traders have made their way to the lands of Kotte in small numbers, and with European traders arriving slowly for trade deals in the region, they too bring their firearms to Kotte for trade deals. Utilizing these wonderful gifts from afar will certainly help Kotte safeguard Kotte's place in the region despite how few of them continue to work in these humid conditions."
 striking_foreign_deals_at_large: "Without Interruption to Foreign Trade"
 striking_foreign_deals_at_large_desc: "Despite whatever happens inland on our island or to the north, we strive ultimately to maintain the course of our trade deals with merchants from afar. They provide wealth and influence that we would never have by just living off domestic production, meaning that keeping the good favor of mercantile folks is what we will continue to do as far as Kotte lives as an independent state."
 ensure_the_royal_family: "Trouble with Royalty"
 ensure_the_royal_family_desc: "If there is one thing about the royal family in Kotte, it is that it is susceptible to hostile intrigue and unfit heirs. In order to rectify this so that Kotte can have a stronger authority over the land as a whole without worry, there should be a system of checks on what the heir should know by certain ages, which means they will be needing an actual education within Kotte. Not only this though, but regularly keeping an eye out for disloyalty in the family itself will help keep it safe since any disloyal members can and will be disowned, denounced, and if possible, tried for their crimes."
 advantage_in_tropical_marsh: "A Tropical Nightmare"
 advantage_in_tropical_marsh_desc: "Kotte's best ally in conflicts, especially when invasions are imminent, is the terrain of the island as a whole. It is a tropical mess if one does not know the lay of the land, and on top of the tropical environment there are plenty of marshes across the entire island including near our capital fortress, meaning that should any invader attempt to subjugate Kotte through brute force, they will be met with an uphill battle unlike anything they have ever faced."

 a_weak_kotte_is_a_strong_kandy: "Weakness in Kotte"
 a_weak_kotte_is_a_strong_kandy_desc: "Kotte is but a mere shell of its former self, and with Kotte's (coming) decline, Kandy can assert itself as a true power across the island! But it won't end there, there are still many claimants around and there is always the threat from across the water as Hindu commanders and ministers would love to see this island become their own. Kandy needs to be ready for any political shift that arises beyond its borders, for these shifts can easily be turned into opportunities."
 the_enemy_of_kandys_enemy_is_who: "The Enemy of my Enemy..."
 the_enemy_of_kandys_enemy_is_who_desc: "The island is rife with various factions and families that want dominance of one community or piece of land and this is true not just toward the coast, but even within Kandy itself. What we need to realize is that the enemies of Kandy's enemies can become Kandy's friends! At least for a short time so as to get us through the specific period we need them. Some might call our diplomatic tactics shady and unreliable, but we see it as what we need to do in order to survive as a cohesive state."
 even_when_defeated_we_can_strike_back: "Defeat is not Death!"
 even_when_defeated_we_can_strike_back_desc: "This land is a land of victory and defeats; the island has seen many great individuals rise and fall and that will continue far into the future. We of Kandy realize the extended version of this in that, defeat for us on the field of battle or in a major war is not the equivalent of death. We can and will strike back for our heartland no matter who holds it as our connections throughout the entire island are far more numerous than anyone can imagine. Age-old ties will be called upon; bonds extended by eras in the past will become fruitful once more."
 to_hold_sole_religious_dominance_here: "There Shall be only One!"
 to_hold_sole_religious_dominance_here_desc: "The island is dominated by our age-old traditions of Theravada Buddhism, yet to be recognized as the dominant state both politically and religiously are needed ultimately. To do as such, Kandy is going to need to extend its power across the entirety of the island eventually and encompass the all holy sites and holy relics found within. We are already partly there as we speak, the rest of the journey is yet to be walked."
 careful_and_calculated_deals: "Deals for Kandy's Survival"
 careful_and_calculated_deals_desc: "Kandy gets several deals and offers from outside states, but we have been too careless in the past with regards to what we sign off on since foreigners have been able to take advantage of Kandy's natural resources and good will. In the future we will need to scrutinize the very contracts we might sign and consolidate with our wider court at large on more matters since diplomacy is at the heart of Kandy's continued survival. One wrong deal and all of Kandy could fall through the floor and into the dungeons of a foreign power."
 just_how_do_we_consolidate_kandy: "Bringing Kandy Together"
 just_how_do_we_consolidate_kandy_desc: "Historically this land has been a nightmare to administrate as the tropical nature of things has made roads very hard to build and towns very slow to grow. Despite these struggles of the past, however, new innovations and new ideas are giving Kandy the tools to better consolidate the administration in general. Enforcing laws is becoming steadily easier and communicating with towns far from the capital is becoming less and less stressful."
 never_let_them_reach_the_heart: "Deny them Sweet Kandy"
 never_let_them_reach_the_heart_desc: "The sweet dream of holding all of Kandy under lock-and-key is in the minds of many on the outside, but we will be working at every point to make sure things stay as they are, a dream for them. Defending the heart of Kandy (that is the inner most parts of the island) through the usage of natural defenses, partisan attacks, and even set traps will help deter any and all invaders from coming to our land. Firearms won't matter much when the weapons are dripping wet and when the wheels for cannons are stuck in the marshes."

 the_impact_of_kutai: "Kutai's Impact"
 the_impact_of_kutai_desc: "Kutai has had a deep and lasting impact on Berau as a whole as indeed it is perhaps the oldest independent polity in the region that we know of. Generations of politics, religious shifts, and diplomatic moves has left Kutai and its nearby lands (like Berau) in a state of flux, but it is through this state of flux that we learn the most, incorporating the best practices from Kutai into our own and attempting to discard what practices do not work on a practical level."
 influences_from_sulu: "Sulu's Influence"
 influences_from_sulu_desc: "A much more recent state of Islamic adherence and indigenous culture, Sulu's influence over these lands that Berau calls home are notable in more ways than one. The masterful sailors and the simplistic yet verstile boats they use are perfect for trade and warfare alike, which is why they have become much more common around our own waters. Berau taking up these practices with regards to shipbuilding and sailing is only natural as looking out to the seas and controlling them through a large, skilled fleet is exactly what we need if we are to survive and thrive."
 blending_muslim_and_hindu_people: "Several Different Religious Communities"
 blending_muslim_and_hindu_people_desc: "Hindu traditions intertwined with indigenous belief systems were the majority in our lands for a long period of time, yet we have increasing numbers of Muslims entering our land to settle down and do business. Whilst we would rather not stoke the fires of religious tension throughout Berau, we cannot deny that these Muslim communities and merchants offer a great deal of insight into how we can manage religious differences across Berau. Whether it is through syncretism, pragmatism, or through extensive religious dialogue, we are beginning to understand just how these different religious communities can co-exist with each other."
 learning_about_how_to_govern_the_tropics: "How to Govern: Tropical Edition"
 learning_about_how_to_govern_the_tropics_desc: "It is no secret that maintaining a strong government in Berau's heartland is very hard as traversing the dense jungle and steep hills is hard enough, but adding humidity and rain on top of it makes things nearly impossible at times; thus, communication between villages and towns that are further inland can become impossible at times. Learning how to manage a somewhat more decentalized system of governance whilst we slowly make progress toward cultivating the land in a way that allows clear paths and eventually sturdy roads is going to be necessary if Berau is to survive."
 from_the_majapahit_empires_influence: "Majapahit's Old Lessons"
 from_the_majapahit_empires_influence_desc: "The time of the Majapahit Empire brought many islands and communities interesting innovations and customs, but the collapse of the empire left several places wondering how they should proceed and implement the power and lessons left unto them. Berau is one of those places left behind and we are only now able to put those old lessons to use via extending our range of trade links and through mastering our own trade routes. The Majapahit Empire opened up a great deal of trade routes near and far from Berau, and now it is time that we take our cut of each one."
 balancing_the_island_powers: "The Balancing Act of Berau"
 balancing_the_island_powers_desc: "The various influential groups across Berau's heartland are tough to balance as it is, yet there are other people groups across different parts of Berau that require our attention as well. Learning to satisfy the desires of each one at least on a basic level can give Berau a great deal of credence in communities on the fringe of the entire state itself as many groups that we must learn to satiate have complex connections to said fringe groups."
 plunder_and_piracy_around_us: "Measure Up to Dishonest Measures"
 plunder_and_piracy_around_us_desc: "The fact that ports across the region and nearby regions are so valuable and open to trade means that those who do not care for regulation and honest trading have a plethora of targets to pick from. Berau can easily become one of those targets, can it not? Our ports are growing and the people of our land are thriving, ensuring that attention is drawn to our land over time, but we must also be prepared to defend these incoming riches from pirates and privateers alike. Defensive fortifications, more discplined naval patrols, friendlier foreign relations, whatever it takes to become a safer haven for traders!"

 wanted_from_all_sides_desc: "We are at the confluence of several states and people groups, all of which want our land because it is valuable in more ways than one. Trying to cultivate a prosperous existence in this tension-filled region is hard enough as it is, but it comes with one advantage at least: we can make great use of our diplomatic channels in various neighboring states. If Basra must survive via diplomacy, then it will do just that!"
 the_capable_port_on_the_gulf: "Rival even to Bandar Abbas"
 the_capable_port_on_the_gulf_desc: "There are other ports and harbors around Basra that provide places for traders to dock at so that they can do business, yet few can see any that are better than Basra, Bandar Abbas, and the island of Hormuz. So crucial are these places that prosperity in this general region might never have come about if these places were not around, which is exactly why we must continue to build up Basra well into the future. It's docks and infrastructure are vital to sustaining a suitable rivalry with the other trade ports and drawing in key traders from afar."
 call_upon_tribal_loyalties: "Loyalty in the Marshes"
 call_upon_tribal_loyalties_desc: "Discontent in the marshes of our land is nothing new as this region near the end of the Tigris and Euphrates River is crossed by Bedouins, Iranians, Kurdish people, and so many others. Some settle down and propagate their teachings, others stop by and do business whilst still leaving an impact on the region, yet all of them usually stoke the flames of unrest in one way or another. As the tension builds, we will harken back to our base of power, the tribes of Basra and its surrounding areas, for capable fighters that know exactly how to defend the land by which they call their own."
 vehement_shiite_and_sunni_sects: "The Heat of Religious Friction"
 vehement_shiite_and_sunni_sects_desc: "Part of the issue Basra faces is the contention between various Islamic sects and schools of thought. They clash in violent skirmishes so as to settle not only who is right in the religious sense, but also who is right in the political sense because Basra is such a valuable piece of land in the region. Whichever we side with in the end, we can be sure that we will have no issues finding religious fervor and zealous preachers amongst the faithful."
 capitalize_on_basras_significance: "Look Upward to Basra"
 capitalize_on_basras_significance_desc: "Despite the hardships we have faced from both external and internal forces, Basra grows ever more through infrastructure development and diplomatic expansions. The road ahead is not going to be easy due to Basra still contending with tribes across the land and foreign states staking claims across our territory, but we are seeing more money line our pockets and a stronger sense of trade power in the markets Basra has some influence in. It is a slow growth rate, but one that can certainly be maintained."
 buffer_zone_on_to_greater_heights: "To Win the Loyalty of Basra"
 buffer_zone_on_to_greater_heights_desc: "With our developments in and around Basra, we are not just building up our own market and administration, but we are also building up a base of loyalty in our own population. Yes tribal feuds and cultural clashes often occur because of our geographic position, but we would be wrong to say that we are not cultivating some sort of success within our own people. Despite what foreign powers would say about Basra's internal situation, we know that there is a growing sense of fealty thanks to our governance."
 to_manage_diseases: "The Final Hurdle"
 to_manage_diseases_desc: "The hardest natural part of Basra that we must strive to overcome is that of rampant disease and famine. When push comes to shove in wars and Basra cannot get imports, famines and plagues spread across the main city and surrounding areas to the point that internal unrest rises dramatically. If we can set up a series of grain reserves, put efforts into making sick camps and soup kitchens, and possibly even build up a suitable navy so that Basra does not have to fear blockades, then maybe we can overcome this final natural hurdle."

 united_somali_communites: "United Somali Communities"
 united_somali_communites_desc: "The various Somali communities and towns that are spread across the Horn of Africa have been fractured in the past, swearing loyalty to different leaders so that one day they would see unification. It was a turbulent path to unity but out of the fires of war and through firm diplomacy, Somali people can finally say with confidence that they are united behind one flag and one state, ready to defend it no matter the cost."
 dominant_merchant_fleets: "Fleets of Somalia"
 dominant_merchant_fleets_desc: "Somali people have made their living off of trade for centuries thanks to the great coastal cities that provide safe places for merchant vessels. Guarding these waters against attacking raiders and such is also part of what earns Somali people prosperity and a good reputation, and it is because of this protective attitude toward our coasts and trade routes that we have amassed such a magnificent fleet."
 hegemony_over_ports: "Harbors of Somali Strength"
 hegemony_over_ports_desc: "Improving and building up our habors and docks is a natural part of promoting trade growth. From setting up new docking areas to building new structures for merchants to do business in, each one of our coastal cities and harbors is key in attracting merchants from everywhere we can think of."
 formal_clan_duties: "Formal Clan Duties"
 formal_clan_duties_desc: "The various clans of Somalia are diverse in their origins and they pose a possible threat to our power if they become dissatisfied with our authority. By structuring the government of Somalia in such a way that it gives each formal clan a workable position in Somalia, we can lessen the threat they pose and increase the amount of resources they give to us, the most important one being men capable of fighting."
 somali_honor_guards: "Somali Honor Guards"
 somali_honor_guards_desc: "We have been the victims of our own ambition, in a sense. We desire wealth and prosperity through trade, thus we lacked the ambition to formulate a proper military on land that could at least defend Somali communities effectively. It is now that we will turn this around and begin instituting strong reforms to the Somali soldiers aimed at instilling discipline in them. It will take a long time to achieve our goals for our military, but laying a solid foundation here and now will go a long way in Somalia's future."
 command_east_africa: "Command of East Africa"
 command_east_africa_desc: "Our ambitions in East Africa are known all across our administration and as we continue to project our power over the great cities of wealth that line the coast of East Africa, we will only see our revenue rise higher and higher. Few can contest the amount of wealth made in cities such as Zanzibar and Mombasa as it is, now imagine how much more wealth they would bring in if we controlled them."
 somali_ocean: "The Somali Ocean"
 somali_ocean_desc: "The vast ocean to our east, it is rife with opportunity if we can claim it for ourselves, but we will not be the only ones sending ships out there to claim trade routes and mercantile chances. Our ships and sailors need to be ever present and ever vigilant of what threats there are to our extensive trading in the ocean, and when intruders try to break into the Somali Ocean despite our hegemony, we will gladly send them to the dark depths of the ocean."

 the_free_despotate: "The Free Despotate"
 the_free_despotate_desc: "Stefan Lazarevic was the first despot of Serbia, crowned with the title in 1402 by the Byzantine emperor Manuel II Palaiologos. Though this title was normally used to denote a subject state of Byzantium, the lack of power projected forth by the ruinous Byzantium meant that Stefan was able to rule on his own, making deals and decisions on his own for the good of all of Serbia. This title will be passed on from generation to generation and it will forever mark us as both an Orthodox bastion and a key state in the entirety of the Balkans."
 the_tenuous_diplomacy_of_serbia: "Tenuous Diplomacy"
 the_tenuous_diplomacy_of_serbia_desc: "We have had to make friends and enemies throughout all of the Balkans in order to survive. The Ottoman Empire brings with it both perilous threats but also powerful chances at greatness if we can play our cards right, but the Hungarians and Austrians to our north also provide chances at greatness elsewhere. Whatever path we choose, let us make sure that our diplomats are firmly ready to adapt to whatever situation we find ourselves in."
 hussars_of_the_hungarians: "Serbian Hussars!"
 hussars_of_the_hungarians_desc: "The Ottoman Empire is bringing with it a new age of warfare that requires us to adapt rather quickly in order to survive. Heavy cavalry with scale or plate armor is quickly becoming obsolete whilst mobility and quick strikes are becoming more and more advantageous for armies all around the Balkans. We will go along with this move to light cavalry and begin setting up our regiments of so-called 'hussars' for future battles."
 libraries_and_development_of_serbia: "Revitalize Serbia's Development"
 libraries_and_development_of_serbia_desc: "The development of Serbia as an independent bastion of Orthodox Christianity with a distinct South Slavic twist has been hampered by warfare to our south, political dealings in every direction, and attempts to expand Serbian power outward instead of consolidating power inwards. It is time that we look toward our cities like Belgrade and Novo Brdo and develop them with both libraries and schools so that our people can look to a brighter future in their own land."
 silver_mines_of_serbia: "Luxurious Silver"
 silver_mines_of_serbia_desc: "Silver mines in Serbia are some of the most prized parts of the land and we must work to keep them both productive and safe. Not only this, but minting coins and taking on the circulation of minted coinage is going to be hard for our administration, but one that will help strengthen the independent status of Serbians as a whole in the Balkans."
 serbian_vlasts: "The Vlasts of Serbia"
 serbian_vlasts_desc: "Dividing our territory into a series of districts is a bit controversial, but it's going to be needed if we are to manage Serbian lands effectively. The governors of these vlasts will of course pay fealty to the Serbian despot and through their administrative divisions, uphold certain civilian and minor military duties, thus helping project our central authority over a larger distance."
 hadjuk_irregulars: "The Help of Hajduks"
 hadjuk_irregulars_desc: "In the rural areas near the edge of Serbian borders and in places where Serbian communities are governed by a foreign power, an irregular kind of infantry is showing up time and time again. We aren't sure how the term 'Hajduk' came about, but this term for these irregular fighters is what most state call them. If we of Serbia can hire them or even integrate various Hadjuks into our military and also look into their fighting styles for our own benefit, the entirety of our military will surely become better in terms of quality and quantity."

 tin_hinan_of_hoggar_desc: "It was under her guidance in the centuries of our past that the Tuareg people found their initial footing. Her tomb lies in the Hoggar Mountains today and we of Sultanate of Agadez (as with many other Tuareg groups) revere her and her work. By acting as she did and following in her footsteps, we too can be an example to all of the Tuareg people that we lead."
 islamic_but_relaxed: "Our Version of Islam"
 islamic_but_relaxed_desc: "Though many Tuareg communities may have adopted Islam as their own religion, there are several practices and theological aspects that we retain from before we were introduced to Islam. It is this blending of traditional Tuareg beliefs with Islamic teachings that we have come to be as we are, a widespread people encompassing a great many cities and villages as well as several trade routes."
 widespread_tuareg_connections: "Widespread Tuareg People"
 widespread_tuareg_connections_desc: "Tuareg people live in both North Africa, the Sahara, and the Sahel without worry and are often the ones that can ensure safety for trade routes that go across the great Sahara. Not only this, but Tuareg people have also settled in various cities in the north and south, making our connections even wider than others might initially think. Perhaps in places like Timbuktu, Tunis, Oran, and Bornu we will see our influence increase as time goes on."
 masters_of_the_sahara: "Masters of the Sahara"
 masters_of_the_sahara_desc: "We are indeed the undisputed masters of the Sahara and this is known by many states on the northern side and southern side. We know just how to navigate the cruel sands, how to use camels to their greatest extent, and how to conduct warfare throughout the merciless sands that fill up the barrier between North Africa and West Africa. If any wish to challenge us in our domain or elsewhere, we will use what skills we have against them."
 unify_tuareg_amenokals: "Unite the Amenokals"
 unify_tuareg_amenokals_desc: "The most paramount of chiefs in Tuareg communities is called the Amenokal, and they usually lead large confederations of Tuareg people in general. Though we are slowly changing from this traditional style of ruling over own people, the amenokals are still vital to our power and we continue to respect them in day-to-day activities, though those that swear fealty to us will need to compromise on some matters concerning governance."
 civil_servant_slavery: "Civil Servant Slavery"
 civil_servant_slavery_desc: "The Ikelan (meaning 'to be black') are a distinct slave class in Tuareg society and they sometimes live in their own separate communities from the main Tuareg community, though even then they act as civil servants and such. Acquired through raiding various states in West Africa and also through various states subject to Tuareg authority, these slaves acting as civil servants of sorts will do well in maintaining the growing economy of the Agadez Sultanate."
 reexamine_tuareg_hierarchy: "Reexamine Tuareg Hierarchy"
 reexamine_tuareg_hierarchy_desc: "For centuries the hierarchy of the Tuareg people has been unchanged due to the relatively stable nature of trade across the Sahara and the nature of cyclical politics in West Africa. But as things are changing and new concepts on society and administration are making their way into our state, we are increasingly being asked by our people to reform the old Tuareg societal hierarchy. It would take time and effort and perhaps disrupt some internal relations, but perhaps this path of reformation could be for the best if we are to sustain a lasting state for the Tuareg people."

 begin_the_fulani_jihad_desc: "The states that lie around us are impious in a number of ways and also seek to bring down our righteous caliphate from where it currently stands. We will not stand idly by as these states threaten our way of life and our thirst for Islamic scholarship, no, we will wage jihad on these kafirs and infidels! To war, my brothers and sisters, to war!"
 commander_of_the_faithful_sokoto: "Amir al-Mu'minin"
 commander_of_the_faithful_sokoto_desc: "Our leader is not only the religious leader who helps administrate the Islamic laws of Sokoto, but he is also the Amir al-Mu'minin, the Commander of the Faithful. Since our inception this has been the case and as time goes on, the radiant aura that stems from our Amir al-Mu'minin will help bring more people to Islam and more people to the banners of Sokoto."
 the_pledge_of_many_emirates: "The Pledge from Many Emirates"
 the_pledge_of_many_emirates_desc: "Direct annexation and conquest is by no means the only way in which Sokoto can go about extending power throughout the region of the Sahel, the lands of the Niger River, and former lands of the Mali Empire. Through establishing firm alliances and making subject states out of various people groups, Sokoto's can become more and more influential whilst also promoting various emirs to establish emirates instead of states run by kafirs."
 indirect_warfare_of_sokoto: "Indirect Warfare"
 indirect_warfare_of_sokoto_desc: "The forests, savannah, and dry deserts of West Africa make for an interesting landscape to fight in and the Fulani people know this for a fact. For centuries they've been more pastoral and nomadic in their ways, but since Sokoto has come about there are thousands upon thousands of Fulani people settling down in cities and taking up actual gunpowder weapons to fight with. Thus, we are learning to utilize the landscapes we've lived in for centuries with these new weapons of war."
 slave_empire_of_west_africa: "Slave Empire of West Africa"
 slave_empire_of_west_africa_desc: "The distinction between a slave and a regular person in Sokoto is different when compared to how the fiendish Europeans conduct slavery. In Sokoto and indeed in many other West African states that came before Sokoto, slavery is and was common and involved working plantations and working in the military with at least better conditions than those offered by Europeans, but still they could be sold and traded around. Being that Sokoto is as powerful as it is, the trade of slaves is going to continue in West Africa for now."
 build_up_ribats: "Ribats for the Land"
 build_up_ribats_desc: "Small fortifications to protect the growing frontier and to also protect trade routes and to act as a place of pious worship, that is what a ribat is. Though not too common in West Africa, we are going to change that around and begin building them throughout the land we hold since they are very useful in holding down land that we may find to be unruly and hard to administrate."
 elected_by_islmaic_scholarship: "Islamic Scholarship Prerequisite"
 elected_by_islmaic_scholarship_desc: "The caliph of Sokoto must always be educated in Islamic scholarship and not only Maliki jurisprudence, but also various other schools of Islamic jurisprudence since religious debate is going to be around in Sokoto. By ensuring that each possible candidate of ours is firmly educated in these topics related to Islam, there will be no doubt that the caliphs of Sokoto are the most pious of all Islamic leaders."

 #Tibetan Ideas#
 monasteries_of_tibet: "The Holy Sites of Tibet"
 monasteries_of_tibet_desc: "The great holy sites of Tibet are never too far away. Whether they are monasteries with religious significance or monuments with cultural traditions attached to them, Tibet is full of them and our protection of them in a unified Tibetan state only deepens our legitimacy amongst the our people. There are few who can lay claim to such piety and devotion as us."
 great_works_of_thang_tong_gyalpo: "Great Works of Thangtong Gyalpo"
 great_works_of_thang_tong_gyalpo_desc: "The Iron Bridge Maker himself has left a monumental impact on Tibet and its people, so much so that many schools and sects of Tibetan Buddhism would not be where they are today if it was not for him. His great works are too many to list off, but we can rest assured that his earthly and spiritual work will never be forgotten by us."
 household_castles_for_bonpos: "Bon Dzongs"
 household_castles_for_bonpos_desc: "The older, traditional faith of Tibet still lurks around, practiced by some communities here and there but it has largely been replaced by Buddhism as a whole. Still, some practices, such as the concept of a dzong, are prevalent throughout Tibetan communities. For the dzong in particular, it is said that in the construction of a house it is in a sense making it like a castle to protect from malevolent forces outside of it. Various rituals and practices from the Bon faith go along with this of course and it helps serve to keep our people very vigilant and protective."
 the_nyingma_school: "The Nyingma School"
 the_nyingma_school_desc: "It is the oldest tradition of the four major schools of Tibetan Buddhism and incorporates some practices and rituals from the old Bon faith. The traditions of the Nyingma school are usually passed on via loose oral networks of its practitioners and it is because of how loose it can be that others outside of our main faith can find solace in it. Though, we will always encourage them to come toward the true path of Buddhism, that will not change."
 the_kagyu_schools: "The Kagyu Schools"
 the_kagyu_schools_desc: "Born in the 11th century by Indian Mahasiddhas (someone who embodies the 'siddhi of perfection') Naropa, Maitripa, and Marpa Lotsawa, the Kagyu school grew into a number of other different sub-schools. The Karma Kagyu school, Drikung Kagyu school, Taklung Kagyu school, Shangpa Kagyu school, and the Drukpa Lineage are all children of the Kagyu tradition and with their favor and assistance in both civil and military matters, Tibet will be all the more powerful and unified."
 the_sakya_school: "The Sakya School"
 the_sakya_school_desc: "The 'pale earth' school comes from the second period of translation of Buddhist scripture from Sanskrit into the Tibetan language in the late 1000s and was firmly established by the 'Great Sakyapa', Sachen Kunga Nyingpo. The Sakya school has a historical foundation of authority over various people unlike what others might think at first glance since, the Sakya lamas were given authority from the Yuan Dynasty to govern over Tibetan land as a vassal state of sorts. We would do good to utilize the governing capability of the Sakya religious officials as Tibet gains more ground in the world."
 the_gelug_school: "The Gelug School"
 the_gelug_school_desc: "The foundations of the Gelug school date to the life of Je Tsongkhapa (1357-1419) and his actions. He founded the Ganden Monastery where the Ganden Tripa is the spiritual leader of the entirey school itself, but the most influential political figure that also holds religious significance has undoubtedly been the Dalai Lama. The Gelug school stresses a variety of matters just as all schools of thought do, but the Gelug school emphasizes vinaya (monastic discipline) more so than others, and it is this disciplined attitude that we will cultivate in our hearts and minds, both in times of peace and in times of war."

 languages_around_us_desc: "All around the Shan people there are various people groups that have their own history, language, and traditions. As the Shan people go forth, it will become necessary to become more culturally understanding of these various groups no matter if they are of our own faith or not."
 centralize_the_shan_states: "Centralize the Shan States"
 centralize_the_shan_states_desc: "The various states of the Shan people have been quite decentralized throughout their history. The Pagan Kingdom attempted to round up the Shan states into a confederacy of sorts, but it barely held together for more than a few decades before falling apart. If we are to be different this time around, we must work on a central administration that can pass effective laws and be heard to the point of all Shan states answering to the central administration."
 hill_and_jungle_fights: "Highland and Tropical Warfare"
 hill_and_jungle_fights_desc: "Learning to move quickly and with intent is key to surviving in the regions that the Shan people call home. Fighting in the jungles and hills is no easy task, but it has trained our soldiers over time to make precise and calculated movements with ease. We'll be sure to use this skill against any state that seeks to stand against our intentions."
 contest_for_the_irrawaddy_valley: "Contest for the Irrawaddy River"
 contest_for_the_irrawaddy_valley_desc: "The great Irrawaddy River is prized by so many communities and states near the Shan people that it is not shocking to see that there are so many that would wage war over it. We are no different in this sense because we too have interest in the Irrawaddy River and what it provides. It can truly become an agricultural and commercial heart for the Shan people."
 communities_that_stand_together: "The Shan Stand Together"
 communities_that_stand_together_desc: "Through the hard times of the past and being part of various great kingdoms and dynasties, the Shan people have come to know who is friend and who is foe, but most importantly, who is their family. The Shan move and work to protect each other from those who seek to smite them down; they will not be divided again."
 the_chronicles_of_our_leaders: "Chronicles of our Leaders"
 the_chronicles_of_our_leaders_desc: "One consistent form of historical documenting that the Shan people have done over the centuries is that of chronicles of former leaders. Granted much of the previous ones have mythical elements embedded within them, the more recent chronicles of Shan rulers are more accurate and true-to-life. Keeping a running history of our rulers into the future will help enshrine legitimacy within the royal family."
 inter_religious_dialogue: "Encourage Religious Dialogue"
 inter_religious_dialogue_desc: "Whilst accepting different cultural traditions is one matter, accepting different faiths is another to many in the Shan administration. Our work now comes toward promoting peaceful and helpful dialogue between religious minorities and those of our true faith so that we can see them as not just filthy non-believers, but rather people deserving of peace and prosperity like so many others."

 al_qarawiyyin_university_desc: "Founded by Fatima al-Fihri in 859 in Fez, the past dynasties of Morocco have kept the university as a madrasa and as a place for higher education. With a great accumulation of manuscripts, texts, scholars, students, and worshippers from all over the Islamic world and beyond, it is in our best interest to keep the university open to all in our domain. Not only this, but we should also expand it when and where possible so that our strive for educational prowess is never hindered."
 pious_past: "Pious Past"
 pious_past_desc: "Morocco has been the seat of the Almoravid Dynasty and the Almohad Caliphate from centuries past; not only this, but the Fatimid Caliphate and the Caliphate of Cordoba also attempted to garner influence in Moroccan lands before as well. Such piety that has been imbued within our people should not go unnoticed by us in our current state for we have the foundation to become a truly wondrous Islamic bastion in the west. On the frontier of Africa and the Islamic world, Morocco will stand tall and as an example to many."
 fleet_bases_of_morocco: "Fleet Bases in Morocco"
 fleet_bases_of_morocco_desc: "The inland parts of Morocco are arid and hot to a good degree, but the coasts are where value can be found at little cost. Fleet bases and dockyards fit for a burgeoning and expanding navy is what Morocco has needed and will need in order to survive. Threats to the north and to the east are going to utilize the wide open coasts against us, let us see to it that they are not given up without a great fight out on the water first!"
 promote_corsair_efforts: "Promote Corsair Efforts"
 promote_corsair_efforts_desc: "Pirates and corsairs of the North African coast, they take no mercy on their enemies and rule the waves in which they call their own. Morocco has historically been a good haven for them since contracts can be made with said corsairs against the Christian north. By utilizing them even more in the future, we'll stand a better change at defeating any enemies we have out at sea."
 revered_and_honored_leaders: "Revere Our Leaders"
 revered_and_honored_leaders_desc: "It is right and just that we look up to the past leaders of Morocco, those who once stood tall against threats to our people and helped the region itself prosper despite the challenges set forth. As new great leaders come and go for the Moroccan people, we should build a proper tomb complex so that they are never forgotten by future generations and so that their tales and stories may live on well after they have left this physcial world."
 centralize_power_curtail_tribes: "Centralize Authority; Curtail the Tribes"
 centralize_power_curtail_tribes_desc: "The tension between ethnic Moroccans and ethnic Berbers, its constant issue that we will need to deal with somehow. Tribal connections are present all throughout Morocco and they can play a huge role in politics as we have seen in the past, but we should not be afraid of trying to rein in said tribes. Centralizing power and authority is going to be crucial to keeping the internal aspects of Morocco stable and prosperous."

 #Portuguese Ideas#
 dom_henry_the_navigator: "Infante D. Henrique of Portugal"
 dom_henry_the_navigator_desc: "The central figure to the Portuguese people that is Henrique of Portugal (also known as Prince Henry the Navigator) should be revered by both the people and our administration. His acts of developing early maritime trade for the Portuguese Empire would help initiate and sow the seeds for the Age of Exploration. Along with this, he would help lay the foundation for our rise onto the world stage of international politics."
 feitorias: "Feitorias!"
 feitorias_desc: "What better way to facilitate trade than to open up what is essentially a Portuguese-founded entrepot for trade activity? It will not only bolster our own trading prowess and power abroad, but it will also also help increase our influence over sea routes and land routes that surround the feitoria. Lining our pockets with coins from the world over will become easier than ever before!"
 naval_bases_and_slave_trade: "Naval Bases and the Slave Trade"
 naval_bases_and_slave_trade_desc: "To help secure our hold on trade power in various sectors and to help facilitate the rather profitable slave trade, we will need a variety of naval bases scattered about on our coastal holdings. Portuguese ships will be able to resupply and repair at these bases before going back off to patrol trade routes, engage in overseas conflicts, or carry forth the wonders of Portuguese trade."
 lucrative_gold_exploits: "Lucrative Gold Exploits"
 lucrative_gold_exploits_desc: "Now that gold is streaming into our administration, we will need to spend it wisely. Investing the gold into production techniques that go forth to extracting more from the land (especially precious metals) will benefit Portugal very nicely in the future without compromising the economic integrity of our state. At least, that is what we hope."
 the_bandeirantes_of_portugal: "Bandeirantes of Portugal"
 the_bandeirantes_of_portugal_desc: "Our colonial holdings are far from home, that is obvious, but what is less obvious to people is just how much freedom some of the military officials and administrators have. The land is spread out, less populated than our own land in Iberia, and ready for explorers of every kind to venture out with small retinues of troops to claim land and find mineral wealth. So what if the native people get in the way, they can be rounded up and serve the colonial administration or they can die trying stave us off; even the latter gives us a benefit in training our colonial regiments in warfare of varying terrains."
 #portuguese_marines: "Portuguese Marines"
 #portuguese_marines_desc: "With the advent of overseas wars and conflicts, the Portuguese infantry (more specifically, the Portuguese marines) need to be well versed in how to attack and defend in a variety of situations. From amphibious invasions and defenses in a number of harrowing conditions, they will be hardened and trained well in fending off any who dare make war with the Portuguese."

 secure_the_trade_monopolies_desc: "The other Europeans would have the Portuguese ousted out of the competition on the high seas, they would keep the trade routes to themselves and force us into economic submission! We cannot let this happen or even begin to happen!

 rememeber_the_strato_da_mar_desc: "The Republic of Venice is powerful indeed and has held sway over several key parts of the Adriatic Sea as well as the Aegean Sea and the Eastern Mediterannean Sea. Though the time of Venice in the glory of the sun is coming to an end, the work they did in Greek lands is certainly not. The prosperity they kept in Greek islands as well as Greek mainland towns is what we are striving to keep alive and well. This in turn is leading us to promote a more expansive navy and a wider range of potential trade partners."
 protect_byzantine_arts: "Protect Byzantine Art and Architecture"
 protect_byzantine_arts_desc: "It was during the 10th century to approximately the time of the Fourth Crusade in 1204 that the revival of Byzantine art occurred in the lands of Greece. Mainland Greece certainly benefited from this revival since it was endowed with many great churches and cathedrals, but we must not rest yet! These sacred and beautiful places are always in danger of being raided and destroyed by invaders and thus we must protect what gives us lasting prestige and beauty."
 greek_resistance: "Greek Resistance"
 greek_resistance_desc: "When the Turkish forces came in from the east, many Greeks did not simply bow down to their onslaught and conquering emirs and pashas. They stayed reserved and hidden away, selectively peaking out to struggle against the Turkish forces so that they were not completely decimated. This resistant Greek spirit lives on without end to this very day no matter who the invader is or where they come from."
 diaspora_of_greek_people: "The Greek Diaspora"
 diaspora_of_greek_people_desc: "The Turks not only conquered our territory, but they also helped make for a great exodus of Greek people from the mainland. Toward the rest of Europe did they head off to, serving in other courts around Europe in the hopes that one day they may return home and serve a truly Greek state. That time has now come and as they arrive back, our good name will spread around the likes of Europe without failure."
 lifted_from_the_ground_up: "From the Depths of Poverty"
 lifted_from_the_ground_up_desc: "As Turkish authority tightened on Greeks, the rules also tightened in certain areas, leading to Greeks becoming impoverished and left to worse conditions than how they were after the Fourth Crusade. Now that we can sustain ourselves and function properly, the Greek people will come back up from the depths of poverty and rise back to the urban cities that they once knew. Coastal trade centers will come back to life and our once grand cities will know splendor like never before."
 revival_of_greek_thinking: "Revival of Greek Intellect"
 revival_of_greek_thinking_desc: "Greece as a region has been the center of many great philosophical innovations as well as the site of great advances in ancient and classical technologies. Honoring this past by promoting Greek intellect in schools and universities will put the Greek people back on the map of scientific and philosophical innovation."
 enduring_heritage: "Enduring Heritage"
 enduring_heritage_desc: "No matter who they were in the past, no invader could dislodge and remove Greek culture from the land. Try as they might to spread it thin or shift it from the great cities of Athens, Sparta, Thessaly, and many others, these foreign occupants have done nothing but further contribute to the enduring legacy and heritage of the Greek people. We are without perfection, that much is certain, but we are not without the greatest living spirit in all of Europe."

 santiago_de_compostela_desc: "Inside our great city of Santiago de Compostela is the hallowed cathedral in which the Way of St. James ends at. A pilgramage sight for Christians in several communities inside and outside our borders, Santiago de Compostela will serve as the foundational place by which Galicia rises up and in the world. Few will be able to match our piety and honor and we will use this to our advantage."
 reestablish_the_bishoprics: "Reestablish the Bishoprics"
 reestablish_the_bishoprics_desc: "In the time of the 9th, 10th, and 11th centuries, the old bishoprics of Galicia were not just religious authorities that Galicia communities looked up to, but they were also political players that meddled in matters of governance normally reserved for dukes and kings; some bishoprics were even seen as warlords since they could wield the weapons of levied armies in opposition to others around them. Reviving these old bishoprics could be very beneficial to Galicia as a whole, but we will need to keep a very tight leash on them so that they do not destabilize the state as a whole."
 claimant_of_iberia: "Claimant of Iberia"
 claimant_of_iberia_desc: "Many have forgotten the times when Galicia was a true power in Iberia. Many simply see Castile, Aragon, and Portugal as the crowned powers that shall hold Iberia in its entirety, but Galicians are not bound to this destiny by any means. The chains imposed by the crown of Castile and the subsequent power grabs by all three aforementioned powers will not stay for long, for Galicia will take to the sword and musket to break free. Iberia will not stay silent, it will be contested for!"

 attracting_christian_pilgrims_desc: "Santiago de Compostela may be Christian pilgramage site, but times have changed and there are plenty of people outside of Iberia that have forgotten or who do not know of the Way of St. James. Let us send envoys out to various lands across Europe and beyond to encourage people to visit our land so that they can know not just the beauty and wonder of Galician land, but also the piety of its people from all walks of life."
 galician_town_charters: "Galician Town Charters"
 galician_town_charters_desc: "To help organize city growth and city planning, we should take to heart the notion of town charters that was taken up by our past rulers. Such town charters will allow for more careful and closer governance so that cities are not left to manage themselves in an unregulated fashion. In time, aspects like city councils, guilds, and social mobility will be a reality within Galician towns."
 revive_compostela_for_galicia: "Revive Compostela"
 revive_compostela_for_galicia_desc: "Some may say Santiago de Compostela is a lonesome city in the hills and that it is a wasteland, but those people know not of what they say! Though the city is not as grand as say, Toledo or Barcelona, it still has great potential for economic growth and urbanization. Promoting its regal status from before and funding new infrastructure projects that can turn the communtiies within into functioning and profitable sectors will help bring not only the area around Santiago de Compostela into greatness, but Galicia as a whole."
 power_of_the_irmandinos: "The Irmandinos!"
 power_of_the_irmandinos_desc: "When people think to the Irmandino Revolts, some think they were just rowdy peasants who wanted the heads of nobles whilst others look to them as heroes of the lower classes. It would be beneficial to Galicia to paint them in a more heroic light so that those troops that we levy and train from rural communities are more inspired to fight for Galicia. We certainly do not want a second set of Irmandino Revolts, but we also must learn to harness the tenacity and will that those once brave fighters had in themselves."

The lands of Scandinavia have been disunited for several decades before our time, but we must have the strength and the will to see to it that the region is united! The Danish people already look to its royal administration with great pride, it is time that we ensure that pride stays in their hearts and minds."
 danish_economic_overhaul: "Economic Overhaul of Denmark"
 danish_economic_overhaul_desc: "The way we have done finances up until now has been rather disorganized and fairly decentralized; some say it is why Denmark has been unable to project its power outward like it was once able to in the times of Cnut the Great. These ways of decentralized finances must be done away with! An economic overhaul internally in the administration and in the naval sector (since the latter is a large part of our expenses) is necessary so that our treasury and our salaries are dealt with on equal ground by educated and skilled workers."

 claims_across_the_north_desc: "From the Danelaw in the British Isles to the lands of Scandinavia itself and even parts of the eastern Baltic Sea, Denmark remembers what it had in the past. Trade posts and conquered territory alike, the Danish will obtain what it once lost so long ago and soon, all of the northern lands will see just how powerful we are. What we must refine in our conquests though, is how we take in and govern foreign people so that they are not revolted by how we speak, write, and conduct business on a day-to-day basis."
 northern_trade_hegemon: "Northern Trade Hegemon"
 northern_trade_hegemon_desc: "The trade routes of the North Sea and the Baltic Sea are absolutely key to the survival of the Danish economy and we have always been a solid contender for controlling both regions. The Hanseatic League, the English, the Swedish, and the Russians all seek to tie down Denmark in terms of trade, but we must work against them effectively to steer trade contracts and trade ships into our favor."
 the_question_to_us_christians: "Questions of Faith"
 the_question_to_us_christians_desc: "Faith has been key to the people of Denmark for a very long time, but so as the dissatisfaction with the Catholic Church itself. We must ask ourselves harrowing questions on what path we will choose as the Protestant Reformation goes forth: What teachings will guide us? What theology is even remotely correct? What will the political outcome be if choose a certain faith over another? Whatever we choose amidst the fire and smoke, the Danish people will surely be happy with it."
 legal_overhaul: "Legal Reformation and Compilation"

These various places under our mandala system, they must pay tribute to our capital regularly and contribute military forces to the mutual defense when needed. What we need to watch for is when these parts of our mandala system begin to get restless and hungry for power; such ambitions could easily rip the kingdom apart."

Business never stops flowing in Ayutthaya, that is surely one key aspect of it."
 need_for_the_corvee_system: "A New Manpower System"
 need_for_the_corvee_system_desc: "Wars in South East Asia are often decided not by technological differences, but by who has the larger army in battle. To supply our armies and to ensure that we always have the larger military force at the ready, we need to institute a new system called the 'corvee system'. With some captured people being brought back to serve in various position on the lower rungs of society, Ayutthaya will have a consistent supply of manpower to draw upon."
 compile_the_dharmasastra_legal_code: "The Dharmasastra Legal Code"
 compile_the_dharmasastra_legal_code_desc: "To help govern the land, we should draw upon not only Thai traditions but also on Hindu customs too since they have been very influential in the history of the Thai people as a whole. We may not adopt the caste system that is prevalent out in the west, but we should adopt a bureaucracy of officials set in a heirarchy that can be managed and maintained by the administration of Ayutthaya."
 center_of_thai_literature_production: "Center of Thai Literature"
 center_of_thai_literature_production_desc: "With our splendid governance over the land, it should be no surprise that the people in villages and cities are becoming more and more creative. Literature in the Thai tradition may have been slow to develop before our time, but we have essentially broken the barrier that stood in the way of our people before, allowing them to flourish in writing various poetic literature in the 'rai', 'khlong', and 'klon' forms."

 #Ilkhanid Ideas#
 restoration_of_the_past: "A New Age of Ilkhans"
 restoration_of_the_past_desc: "Founded by Hulagu Khan, son of Tolui and grandson of Ghengis Khan, in 1256, the Ilkhanate ruled much of what was the southwestern portion of the once grand Mongol Empire. It was an empire that held tenuous power over the region of Persia and neighboring areas to the west and north, but its power was great enough to continuously challenge the Mamluk Sultanate for control of the Levant. Still, the Ilkhans were subordinate to the Great Khan of the east situated at the head of the Yuan Dynasty, but this is no longer the case. Our leader is no longer subservient to a far away khan, but rather leads the empire on his own accord."
 internal_tolerance: "Promote Internal Tolerance"
 internal_tolerance_desc: "From Hulagu to Baydu, the Ilkhans were relatively indifferent to religions though they kept Buddhism around in Persian lands for quite some time despite the region being majority Islamic in essence. It was not until Baydu's overthrowing by Ghazan that Islam was adopted as the official faith of the Ilkhanate in 1295 (after a majority of Mongol emirs had already converted to Islam), though it was not until the death of the influential Mongol emir Nawruz that religious tolerance was achieved to a great degree. We would be wise to learn from Nawruz's failures and flaws and work to consistently improve upon our religious tolerance."
 improve_upon_past_science_inquiry: "Improve our Scientific Outlook"
 improve_upon_past_science_inquiry_desc: "A great observatory in Maragheh was built by the early Ilkhans, though since then chaos has reigned throughout the region and as such scientific inquiry has been left to gather dust in a lonely corner. With our establishment of power in the region and the coming about of the Ilkhanate once more, we could easily patronize and rework our inquiry into scientific matters since times of peace and stability will help keep great buildings like observatories and libraries intact and functional."
 versed_mongolian_conquests: "Versed in Mongolian Conquests"
 versed_mongolian_conquests_desc: "Though the Mongol Empire may be gone and fragmented beyond repair to many, what is not gone is the way the Mongol Empire conquered people and eased them into the fold of other conquered people. We would do well to learn and possibly refine this method of conquest as time goes on so that the Ilkhanate can continue to project its power in the future whilst also ensuring an easier path to peace for our realm."
 ghazan_style_reform_edicts: "Inspiration from Mahmud Ghazan"
 ghazan_style_reform_edicts_desc: "Mahmud Ghazan was not only the first Islamic Ilkhan, but he was also a very capable and well-meaning ruler. During his reign, he reformed Ilkhanid finances and fiscal policy (including unified measurements of coinage and weights), issued a new census for the empire, ordered the construction of new hospitals, hostels, schools, and posts for trade, and he also reformed the way in which edicts in the empire's administration were handled. Emulating this reform-minded nature of Ghazan is going to be hard to do, but to keep the Ilkhanate alive is to look to the future and actively engage with it, not to rely purely on the past."
 zamburak_cavalry_arm: "Develop Zamburak Cavalry"
 zamburak_cavalry_arm_desc: "Whilst holding the title of 'Ilkhan' is important as it lends legitimacy in our reign, it is important that we do not stay stagnant in military strategy like our ancestors may have. Persian lands make heavy and large cannons hard to carry around, so we must devise new ways of incorporating gunpowder weapons into our ranks. One innovative invention is what some call the 'Zamburak', literally meaning 'wasp', and it is a swivel-mounted small cannon mounted on the back of camels. Utilizing them in our military will greatly improve our effectiveness in future battles and can be seen as an evolution of our ancestors tactics."
 reformed_yam_system: "Reformed Yam System"
 reformed_yam_system_desc: "Much like how Mahmud Ghazan improved upon the Yam system in his time, we too will take to improving it in our time. Constructing more dedicated and central roads for messengers, merchants, civilians, and military personnel to travel on as well as building up new relay stations along the way for our people will ensure that the roads are efficient enough for us. Not only this, but we will employ people to maintain the roads over time so that they do not wither away into impassable patches of land."

 #Hungarian Ideas#
 order_of_the_dragon: "The Order of the Dragon"
 order_of_the_dragon_desc: "Founded in 1408 by Sigismund von Luxembourg, King of Hungary at the time, the Order of the Dragon was a chivalric order founded whilst the crusaders were still ongoing. The initiates were required to defend the cross and fight the enemies of Christanity, especially the Ottoman Empire since they were the biggest threat back then. Though they are declining in importance as time goes on, their legacy gives our troops and military a zeal unlike those around us. Who is to say that the Order of the Dragon is ever truly dead?"
 learning_from_debasing_coinage: "Learn to not Debase Coinage"
 learning_from_debasing_coinage_desc: "Whilst Sigismund von Luxembourg was active in the defense of Hungary and its foreign policy, these activities and engagements required great amounts of money. They required so much money that Sigismund regularly debased currency to the point where Transylvanian peasants revolted in 1438. We need to learn to never step toward this path again, and to ensure that our monarch can handle financial matters in a just way that does not invoke rebellious sentiment."
 southern_contention_with_turks: "Southern Tension"
 southern_contention_with_turks_desc: "The Ottoman Empire is an existential threat to the Kingdom of Hungary, none doubt that. The southern border with them is almost always in contention and it is rare that we are not involved in some sort of conflict against the Ottoman Empire. Should the time come, we need to ensure that our military is large enough and strong enough to withstand any prolonged war against the fiends to the south."
 bibliotheca_corviniana: "Library of Hungary Royalty"
 bibliotheca_corviniana_desc: "We recognize the importance of the manuscripts and texts being produced as a result of the Renaissance and many courtiers and nobles are collecting them for future keeping and reading. If we can perhaps build up a royal library of sorts to store these grand texts and manuscripts, we'll be able to attract more people to read about them and become educated on various matters, contributing to the ongoing scholarly dialogue in Hungary."
 recognize_the_importance_of_firearms: "The Importance of Gunpowder"
 recognize_the_importance_of_firearms_desc: "With gunpowder weapons becoming more and more common, it is becoming clear to all of Hungary that refining the art of making firearms and implementing them formally into our military is needed. If we lack in this aspect, we will be vulnerable to invasions as well as rebellions, possibly even from the Black Army itself if things get to that point."
 reorganize_hungarian_taxes: "Organize Hungarian Taxes"
 reorganize_hungarian_taxes_desc: "The traditional tax laws of Hungary are quite outdated and needlessly complex, having not been changed in decades now. We can refine and streamline them into something more suited to a growing kingdom so that revenue is not only increased, but also easier to manage in general."
 institute_the_decretum_maius: "Institute the 'Decretum Maius'"
 institute_the_decretum_maius_desc: "We have known just how much power the palatine (a high level official in our court) has over judicial matters. The power he has is seen by some to be just, but many of the court know that it is a needless stumbling block that we have had to work around for a long time. It is time that we institute the 'Decretum Maius' and officially cut down the power of the palatine and instead strengthen county magistrates instead since they are the ones that work close with the lower classes of Hungary. This will help bolster our administrative capabilities far into the future."

 #Cascadian Ideas#
 integration_of_native_tribes: "Cascadian Acceptance"
 integration_of_native_tribes_desc: "Unlike other places around the vast continent we lie on, we of Cascadia are not so keen on destroying the lives and communities of native people who already live in these lands. We would rather assimilate them and do good trade with them so that Cascadia can be at peace and also prosper from mutual cooperation. Though this won't always be easy to do, it is much better than ruthlessly excluding all natives from our land."
 expanding_trading_and_production_measures: "Expansive Trade and Production"
 expanding_trading_and_production_measures_desc: "Trade is essentially what Cascadia was founded upon, and production of furs as well as other minor resources is what we also partly rely on to keep us afloat. By taking the time to refine our methods of trade and production we can meet the demands that overseas markets have such as across the Pacific Ocean and even across this vast continent we live on."
 frontier_settler_traditions: "Settling the Frontier"
 frontier_settler_traditions_desc: "Cascadia's land is by no means easy to traverse the further you go toward the mountains. Settlers braved these uncharted trails and setup small villages that grew in size to upstart towns and cities, but these foundational times were also filled with dangers from wildlife and hostile natives. All Cascadians willing to settle the frontier will need to be versed in firearms and survival training, and we know that many will strive for this training since the frontier is a lucrative place for those daring enough to venture into it."
 cascade_mountains: "The Cascade Mountains"
 cascade_mountains_desc: "Tall and steep mountains mark the barrier between the western coast of these lands and the great interior plains where wide open tracts of land are roamed by a variety of people. Traversing the Cascade Mountains requires endurance, stamina, and keen senses, for an ambush from enemy forces could start a deadly skirmish in the perilous heights. Not only this, but surviving off what the land can provide is also needed when moving through the Cascade Mountain, which is why most of our soldiers are also capable hunters and survivalists."
 puget_sound_trade_rights: "Our Pacific Inlet"
 puget_sound_trade_rights_desc: "The inlet on the Pacific Ocean that Cascadia relies heavily upon is becoming more and more popular as time goes on. Trading vessels from all across the Pacific Ocean and even from the Atlantic Ocean stop by in our friendly ports along the sides of the inlet, garnering us more trade revenue, so why not impose some trade taxes and such? We can slowly start projecting our power off the Cascadian coast and ensure that our harbors are even safer, promoting stronger trade ties and attracting even more merchants later on."
 the_need_of_the_pacific_ocean: "Extensive Naval Matters"
 the_need_of_the_pacific_ocean_desc: "Without a fleet of some kind, Cascadia will simply be only half as strong as it really could be. We need to promote naval affairs and the production of ships throughout Cascadia's coast so that we are not left to the mercy of foreign powers and what ships they might have. Plus, the plentiful forests in our land will make for a great amount of material for future ships."
 to_govern_a_hinterland: "To Govern a Hinterland"
 to_govern_a_hinterland_desc: "Cascadia was, when it was a colony still, governed as if it were a hinterland (meaning a place where resources are extracted and shipped off elsewhere far away in order to be processed and refined). Now that we are free from the greedy hands of our former overlords, we can work on governing Cascadia for Cascadians solely. We can address the needs of our people and work on government reforms and legislation at our own pace, ensuring that we are accountable to the people we protect and care for."

 #Sonoran Ideas#
 logistics_of_sonoran_land: "Logistics of Sonora"
 logistics_of_sonoran_land_desc: "To move supplies and materials around Sonoran land is something of an issue for those not used to the region since, well, the arid heat can often lead to people slowing down and animals as well as people suffering from heat stroke and exhaustion. Taking all of this into account and setting up supply stations as well as carving out designated paths throughout the arid lands we inhabit will help cut down how costly moving supplies around is."
 promises_of_future_revenue: "We Promise Future Fortune"
 promises_of_future_revenue_desc: "Whilst not all of Sonora can be used right now, we are developing infrastructure in various places to promote larger and more numerous settlements. Garnering investors for this initiative is not going to be easy, but if we can start a campaign that promises future revenue from these places in exchange for a grant of money and resources now, we will be able to expand Sonora's internal source of revenue and power."
 gold_of_sonora: "Gold Attraction"
 gold_of_sonora_desc: "If it was not for gold and other precious minerals, Sonora would not be what it is today. Indeed the allure of wealth from gold has brought many to Sonora and made them stay indefinitely, but we are much smarter than our former overlords who once governed over us, for we are not just going to let the gold miners run our economics into the ground through inflation. Instead, we will take a firm economic approach that is intent on mitigating inflation as much as possible."
 rifle_riders_of_sonora: "Sonoran Rifle Riders"
 rifle_riders_of_sonora_desc: "Muskets and rifles are what rule these lands now; the old ways of spears and arrows used by the native people is long gone. Our people, both civilian and military in nature, are going to be expected to be able to handle muskets and rifles with care and fire them with precision, and our formal core of officers and commanders are going to be well versed in how to utilize cavalry and infantry fighting in hot Sonoran lands with long range weaponry. Getting up close and personal is something we do not want to do."
 resist_authority_from_afar: "In Defense of Sonora"
 resist_authority_from_afar_desc: "Putting up fortifications like walls of stone throughout Sonora is hard enough as it is as they take a long time to build and require immense amounts of water and food to maintain, but the ones we do have are going to be absolutely pivotal for our defense. Any invaders looking to ravage our lands are going to have to get through our fortifications guarding vital rivers and streams, and even our own towns will be equipped with at least some form of defensive structures like watchtowers or fortified outposts."
 slow_but_steady_growth: "Showing Promise"
 slow_but_steady_growth_desc: "From our inception as a colony, the lands here in Sonora did not look good for widespread settlement and even to this day we find large tracts of land open to the howling wilderness and baking heat of the sun. But, we have grown immensely since our inception and our independence, and we are working toward building a strong, unified Sonoran state that few if any could break down. No matter how far apart they are, Sonoran people will stand united together, with hands together for celebrations and hands on rifles when defending."
 the_politics_of_sonora: "Sonoran Politics"
 the_politics_of_sonora_desc: "The stabilization of Sonoran politics is perhaps the most key aspect of keeping this state together since, if our politics are not stable and different factions lead different parts of the country, they can easily rip apart the population's loyalty as a whole. Formalizing political parties, how people are represented, and how officials will be elected will ensure that the blooming Sonoran state continues to prosper."

 #Crimean Ideas#
 the_reprisals_from_the_golden_horde: "Unjust Reprisals in Crimea"
 the_reprisals_from_the_golden_horde_desc: "In the 1300s and early 1400s, the khans of the Golden Horde used Crimea as a playground of sorts, riding through and striking down various communities when civil war was brewing and forcing people into military service when they initially refused. We have been taught to always be ready for whatever war or conflict may come our way, and our weapons are always within reach for when we need to defend what is rightfully outs."
 capitalize_on_golden_horde_failure: "The Withering Horde of Gold"
 capitalize_on_golden_horde_failure_desc: "Without the influence from the Golden Horde, the khans of Crimea can live freely and without much worry. They failures in politics and military organization that led to the downfall of the Golden Horde are opening paths for us to make gains in the east toward Sarai, so why not take the chance and stake our claim in the land whilst our old overlords are struggling to survive?"
 legitimacy_in_blood: "Legitimacy, through Blood"
 legitimacy_in_blood_desc: "Succession in the Crimean Khanate is bathed in blood for the most part. The heir chosen by the current khan is going to need to fight for his life if he wishes to maintain the throne, and it is this display of power and might through combat that instills legitimacy in our heirs when they come to power. If a khan cannot lead an army into battle and win effectively, then what good is he?"
 turkish_friends: "Turkish Friends"
 turkish_friends_desc: "The Turkish people of Anatolia are strong in their conviction and powerful with their military and navy. They have taken interest in our lands before but not for pure conquest; instead they seem more interested in utilizing us on a more one-to-one scale. Making friends with the Turkish people will undoubtedly help us in the long run and give us more routes of diplomacy for the Islamic world, despite it being still quite far from home."
 refining_our_trained_cavalry: "Refine Crimean Cavalry"
 refining_our_trained_cavalry_desc: "Firearms are what we will need if we seek to survive into the coming era. Equipping our cavalry with firearms and training them to fire and reload them effectively is not going to be easy, but with the help of Turkish military officials and a sustained effort on our own part, we can cultivate a cavalry arm that is more effective than any other."
 black_sea_slave_trade: "Profits from the Slave Trade"
 black_sea_slave_trade_desc: "The slave trade is partly how we make our money since, raiding and looting Christian lands is so easy at times and there are plenty of buyers on the market throughout the Black Sea. Continuing the slave trade and perhaps investing in it elsewhere should continue to help our people profit nicely."
 cossack_friends: "Cossacks? Cossacks!"
 cossack_friends_desc: "What is a 'cossack' to us Crimeans? Are they enemies, or are they friends? Beyond border disputes and some petty squabbles, the cossacks are remarkably similar to our people in their military prowess organization. If we can establish effective diplomatic ties with the various cossack groups throughout the Pontic Steppe and bring some into our fold, our military will be unmatched in how effective it is and how fluid it can be in times of war."

 #Ottoman Ideas#
 kapu_kulu_and_eyalet: "Kapu Kulu & Eyalet Organization"
 kapu_kulu_and_eyalet_desc: "The military forces of Europeans and Muslims around us are something that we should not only learn from, but also strive to be above as time goes on. Organizing our military into two sections, a central force and a peripheral force, will help with this and instill a sense of discipline in the core part of our military as well as the outer part since both will be relied upon as we continue our fight into Europe, Africa, and Asia."
 spahi_cavalry: "Sipahi Cavalry"
 spahi_cavalry_desc: "Cavalry has been a key component of our military since the time we were a mere Beylik. Our ancestors of the Seljuk Empire even depolyed Sipahi cavalry which attests to the history of the unit itself, but we of the Ottoman Empire are in a much different time compared to our ancestors. Our Sipahi must learn more skilled strategies and tactics, how to use gunpowder weapons whilst on their horses, and also how to conduct themselves in line with our Janissaries and artillery."
 turkish_artillery: "Ottoman Artillery"
 turkish_artillery_desc: "Whilst the Europeans and other Muslim states around us progress very little in terms of gunpowder technology, we are absolutely keen on using the fiery material to its greatest extent! Grenades, weapons that are larger than muskets but smaller than cannons, even cannons that seem almost too big to even be fired properly, all of this will be utilized and tried out by the Ottoman military. Only the best designs will survive the test of time and this strive for gunpowder prowess will make our artillery outdo anything Europe or Asia can put forth."
 organized_pashas_and_eyalets: "Of Pashas and Eyalets"
 organized_pashas_and_eyalets_desc: "Setting up strong administrative divisions will be key in governing our growing empire. Pashas and Eyalets can be where we start from and from there, further organization can commend and bring a sense of unity to far off lands under our control; we just need to make sure we keep track of these various pashas and eyalets so that corruption does not get out of hand."
 from_karamursel_do_we_dominate: "From Karamursel Onward"
 from_karamursel_do_we_dominate_desc: "When we took Karamursel, our fleet was small and not able to compete with the likes of Venice or other powers in the Mediterranean Sea. Now that it has been under our control for a long while and our navy has been building up in a variety of ways, Karamursel will become the nucleus of our various fleet, allowing us to field a great amount of galleys and merchant ships that can take on the likes of Venice and Genoa."
 multi_functional_spahis: "Sipahi Funcationality"
 multi_functional_spahis_desc: "The professional Sipahi cavalry are not just used in combat; unlike the Janissaries, the Sipahi are also given grants of land called 'timars' and are expected to enforce law and order in these lands they are given. As a sort of informal police force of sorts yet also an effective cavalry force, the Sipahi variable role in the Ottoman Empire means that we will need more of them as time goes on, especially as our empire continues to expand into new areas."
 claim_the_caliphate: "The Ottoman Caliphate"
 claim_the_caliphate_desc: "Few if any in the Muslim world have reached our height and claimed as much power as we currently have. The piety in our rulers and the power we are gathering as time goes on should show all in the Islamic world that we, the Ottoman Empire, are the true protectors of Muslims from outside forces. Though some Islamic states would defy our righteous authority, in time they will submit to our authority either through peaceful talks or the fires of war."

 #Prussian Ideas#
 confluence_of_poland_and_hre: "At the Confluence of Two"
 confluence_of_poland_and_hre_desc: "The lands of Prussia are in a precarious position as it is. To the south lie the Poles, historically strong and stalwart in their ways and certainly a threat to Prussia; to the west lie the domains of our humble beginning, the Holy Roman Empire, a place of great prestige and also great tension and bloodshed. We of Prussia need to work on making sure both avenues are safe and secure diplomatically, and when intrigue or opportunity arises that we can take advantage of, we will strike whilst the iron is hot and take what land we can no matter how small."
 two_lands_ruled_as_one: "Two Lands, Ruled as One"
 two_lands_ruled_as_one_desc: "There are some outside of Prussia who see our lands as divided into two: one part inside the domain of the Holy Roman Empire and one part outside of it, thus necessitating our authority being over two lands technically. Whilst we don't really see it like this we can at least acknowledge that this is the case on paper and employ an array of diplomats to negotiate deals inside and outside the Holy Roman Empire."
 the_renewed_cross_of_prussia: "The Renewed Cross of Prussia"
 the_renewed_cross_of_prussia_desc: "The dark days of being burdened by the words of a far off Papacy are no longer around, are they? Prussia as a whole has come to learn that there are ways to think about the world and universe that are contrary to the common theology and doctrine touted by Catholics and these different ways of thinking about religious matters shouldn't be persecuted on sight. Instead, we can learn from them and be empowered by them whilst still keeping our relative distance away from the Papacy both theologically and spiritually."
 secular_politics_abound: "Push to Secularize"
 secular_politics_abound_desc: "Secular politics is new to some states but we know it all too well. Our early leaders knew just how key it was to start bringing politics away from the days of the Teutonic Knights of old and more toward a non-religious and grounded method. If we can continue this, we'll be able to govern more people without issue and also keep them from straying away from the legislation we pass."
 integrate_the_junkers: "Junkers Wanted; Junkers Needed"
 integrate_the_junkers_desc: "Landed nobility inside the lands of Prussia hold a great amount of power and it is easy for most anyone to see this. From politics to the economy itself, Junkers could very well be our downfall if they come under the influence of foreigners or if they become disobedient to our authority. That is why we are going to start earnest conversations and negotiations with the Junkers of Prussia to integrate them into the military instead of having them just doing as they please on their various estates."
 attention_to_the_jagers: "Jagers!"
 attention_to_the_jagers_desc: "Warfare is becoming more and more mobile and we are seeing this play out in the lands of Eastern Europe as the generations go by. Gone are the days of heavy cavalry and heavy infantry clad in chain and plate armor; instead we of Prussia are going to focus on what we can see coming through in the coming ages: light infantry! Jagers, or, hunters/skirmishers, are prime candidates for the role 'light infantry' in the Prussian military, we just need to develop the military doctrine that surrounds them."
 to_modernize_the_prussian_army: "Professional Militarization"
 to_modernize_the_prussian_army_desc: "The powers across Europe, from those that rule over France to those that rule over the Italian Peninsula, and from those that rule over Scandinavia to those that rule over Iberia, all are developing modern military structures. It is a slow and tiresome job for large nations, but Prussia is not like those others that want vast swaths of land across the whole of Europe. As we are content with a smaller portion of land, we can focus solely on modernizing Prussian military standards and the structures that go into forming the military itself, and after we do all of this, there will be none that can stand in our path."

 a_stake_through_hre_meddling_desc: "From the days in 1138 when we threw off the shackles of being a sort of march for the Holy Roman Empire, we established a republic that strived to govern Florence itself and the lands surrounding it. Though much has changed since those founding days of 1138, we still retain memories of the days when medieval soldiers and frontier outposts were common sights in our land. We should not let our militaristic past fade away, no, we need to ensure that part of it stays with us into the future, especially since the Holy Roman Empire is an ever present danger to our great republic."

 bridges_and_churches_of_florence_desc: "During the likes of the 1200s and 1300s, Gothic Architecture reached its peak in Florence. Builders and engineers funded by inhabitants of our great city carved out buildings of great prestige and glory that would last generations, and it is through the functional structures that are beautiful bridges and churches that many still know of us. May the heavens above let legacy last far into the future no matter who comes to this brilliant city of Italian culture."

 strive_to_end_deadly_factionalism_desc: "Though we are proud of our republic and how long it has lasted, it is not without its bloody disputes between wealthy families and notable people. Perhaps the greatest known instance of this bloody factionalism is that of the Guelphs and the Ghibellines, with the former supporting the Pope and the latter supporting the Holy Roman Emperor. It is a conflict that we must learn from as the blood spilled by it still stains the history of Florence to this day; if something like it breaks out again, the republic may see never the end of it."
 merchants_around_palazzo_della_signoria: "The Palazzo della Signoria"
 merchants_around_palazzo_della_signoria_desc: "The very town hall of Florence, the Palazzo della Signoria, is where much of the administrative work in the city is done as one might expect. But, what one might not expect is the fact that the merchants who come to Florence often make themselves at home and do business just outside the town hall itself via townhouses. This helps make the prosperity of the city that much more tangible to those who in the administration."
 florentine_banking_prospects: "Banking in Florence"
 florentine_banking_prospects_desc: "Siena may seek to regain its status as one of the most pristine places in the Italian Peninsula to do banking in, but the Republic of Florence will never let that happen! The grandiose and prestigious families of Florence know exactly how to keep on top of things economically, especially with the advent of banking being on the minds of several states around us. Even the Medici bank established in 1397 by Giovanni di Bicci de' Medici can come into use to keep Florence on top of things!"
 complex_italian_politics: "Complexities of Italian Politics"
 complex_italian_politics_desc: "The politics of Italy are never pretty or simple as people in Florence's administration know all too well. If we are to expand our influence outside of the center of the Italian Peninsula, we are going to need to ensure our military contracts with various mercenaries are up-to-date since both the Papacy and the Holy Roman Empire wield considerable power around us."
 stave_off_monarchical_influences: "Glory be to Florence"
 stave_off_monarchical_influences_desc: "To see the Republic of Florence shine through the chaos of war and through the hardships of the Black Death, the Guelphs and the Ghibellines, and the continued efforts of the Holy Roman Empire... It really is a sight to behold, is it not? But the job of maintaining what has been cultivated for so many centuries is never quite done, for the republic can always be improved in some sort of way. Corruption, taxation, foreign influence, and several other matters are going to be what the republic needs to focus on to keep itself independent and strong, but do we have the inner strength to tackle it all? The answer, is yes."

 kindly_say_no_to_the_hre_desc: "Though we have had a number of relations with members of the Holy Roman Empire, we must kindly decline their continued petitions for influence over Tuscan lands. Despite this decline on our part, we can certainly maintain marital ties and economic treaties with those of Austria, Bavaria, the Swiss Cantons, and plenty of other members. All of this is just a reminder of how adept we must be at diplomacy."
 breaking_surrounding_hegemony: "Breaking Surrounding Hegemony"
 breaking_surrounding_hegemony_desc: "Around us are hegemons of power, no? We see in Iberia that Spaniards and Portuguese claim great power almost without end; there are the French to the northwest who contest lands against the English and also the Germans of the Holy Roman Empire; and to our southeast is the Ottoman Empire, carving out great swaths of land in the Balkans for themselves. Tuscany cannot just sit idly by and focus inward on its own perfection, no, it must be ready to break the hegemony around it and seize the various opportunities for power and success! We must let no power stand in our way of getting where we want to be!"
 tuscan_banking_prospects: "Banking in Tuscany"
 tuscan_banking_prospects_desc: "From the humble days of banking prospects in Siena and Florence to where we are now, few could have imagined that the economy of Tuscany would be so strong. The banking sector is where a lot of this power comes from as our honest and smart bankers have taken it upon themselves to invest money, promote development, and choose wisely as to where they should stake their livelihood. Because of all of this, we can safely say: blessed are we of Tuscany who profit from these ambitions for good, and blessed will our administration be should it ever need to rely on loans from internal lenders."
 formulate_the_accademia_del_cimento: "Form the Accademia del Cimento"
 formulate_the_accademia_del_cimento_desc: "If there is one type of person that our prestige and grandeur has attracted, it is the scholarly type of person! Those who seek insights into the scientific nature of the natural world around us and those who seek to know what answers truly lay in the stars above us at night, they will be gathered across Tuscany into one association or society of sorts so that they can collaborate and work on their studies with proper funding and equipment. What will be the name of this place? It will be called the, 'Accademia del Cimento'."
 navigate_politics_with_care: "Careful Deals; Wise Choices"
 navigate_politics_with_care_desc: "And as we sail into the dense fog of the future with our noble robe tucked tight, our coins stashed safely, and our sword sheathed by our side, there will be none who can say that we are not prepared for what is to come. Ever careful with our own politics and our own diplomatic relations, Tuscany can be said to be one of the most well-spoken and well-meaning states sailing into the future, and when troubles rise up to sink our great state, we will fight back with the utmost care and vigor."

 #Venetian Ideas#
 behold_the_venetian_arsenal: "Glory to the Venetian Arsenal"
 behold_the_venetian_arsenal_desc: "Responsible for the bulk of our naval power, the great amount of shipyards and armories collectively called the 'Venetian Arsenal' is something to marvel at, is it not? No other place around Europe can produce as many ships as our arsenal does which means we have a distinct advantage when it comes to holding sway over affairs in the Mediterranean Sea. In time, the arsenal will also help us project our power outwards as we conquer more valuable islands and inlets of trade."
 forza_ordinaria: "The Forza Ordinaria"
 forza_ordinaria_desc: "In the mainland of Venice, we shall be drafting everyone from the age of 20 to 70 to serve in the military or navy. Now we may not need all of these soldiers and sailors at once of course, but ensuring that this law is enforced and we have people ready to fight for Venice is crucial to sustaining its independence. The only curious thing about this ordinance is that most people seem to want to serve in the navy..."
 the_promissione_ducale: "The Promissione Ducale"
 the_promissione_ducale_desc: "In order to help uphold the republican state of Venice and its possessions, every new leader of Venice will be sworn in via the 'promissione ducale', a special oath taken when elected that outlines the limitations in power they have. Venice will not be a place where monarchy reigns supreme, but instead where delegation of power and the limiting of central authority is seen as the right way to govern."
 no_citizen_is_above_the_laws_of_venice: "Laws of the Venetian Land"
 no_citizen_is_above_the_laws_of_venice_desc: "We cannot be a true republic if some people in our lands are above the law and cannot be punished due to their status of nobility or piety. We must ensure that all, even bishops and priests, are subject to the laws of Venice so that corruption does not creep into our land whilst the court system is unable to do a thing about it. The Papacy may not like how we enforce and apply our laws, but at times we must limit how much the Papacy can influence our communities."
 adriatic_hegemony: "Adriatic Dominance"
 adriatic_hegemony_desc: "Home to Italians one the west and Slavic people to the east, the Adriatic Sea is a valuable place of trade that many seek to hold as their own. The only state that is truly capable of utilizing it to its fullest extent is Venice, as we know, but others that border the Adriatic Sea fail to see our rightful claim to it and even wish to contest us for control over it. We will see just how fruitful these endeavors are as the Stato da Mar expands ever further and the fleet of Venice grows more powerful."
 venetian_glass_luxury: "Venetian Glass"
 venetian_glass_luxury_desc: "The great history of Venetian glass, or, 'vetro veneziano', is well known to all of Europe. The Venetian island of Murano is its traditional home and the glass and glass-like products produced in Murano are some of the most pristine items that are treasured by many. As Venetian power expands further out and control over our domain becomes all the more complete, we should work on keeping the secrets of Venetian glass to ourselves so that our pristine products are always in demand."
 venetian_mercenary_military: "Multinational Mercenary Military"
 venetian_mercenary_military_desc: "The core population of Venetian people has never been that large in comparison to the number of different people groups combined together in the Stato da Mar far off from our mainland. Thus, we have come to rely heavily on mercenaries from across Europe and even mercenaries from North Africa and the Levant. By extending these contracts and working toward integrating mercenaries fully into our military force, we can be sure that they will continually be loyal to us and eventually lower their contract prices."

 #French Ideas#
 contentions_from_the_hundred_years: "The Hundred Years' War"
 contentions_from_the_hundred_years_desc: "Starting in about 1337, some 7 years after the death of Charles IV of France without any sons or brothers as possible heirs, the Hundred Years' War has ravaged many villages, towns, and cities across the French region. The right to rule France is ours alone and those of England will be pushed back time and time again, but we cannot deny just how impactful this long conflict has been on us. Martial experience and deep scars now mark our state and it is stronger because of this."
 convening_of_the_estates_general: "Estates General of France"
 convening_of_the_estates_general_desc: "Having its origins in about 1302, the Estates General is a legislative and consultative assembly of different classes in France. The First Estate is that of the clergy, the Second Estate is that of the nobility, and the Third Estate is that of the commoners, and despite the monarch being nearly all-powerful to outsiders, the Estates General has and can still curtail the powers of the monarch to a fair degree. How the Estates General will function as time goes on though, will be another issue entirely."
 wars_of_religion_in_france: "The Fissures in Catholicism"
 wars_of_religion_in_france_desc: "The Protestant Reformation is having profound effects across Europe and we of France are not immune from this. Scholars, officials, and commoners too are converting to Protestantism, Anabaptism, Calvinism, and even other smaller sects that are more obscure. What is most concerning for us is the fact that the Catholic clergy want to crack down on these new heresies, invoking a great amount of unrest throughout the whole of France that could spell doom for the state itself if the unrest is not dealt with."
 trading_colonies_instead: "Establish Trade Colonies"
 trading_colonies_instead_desc: "Just as the Protestant Reformation burns brightly across Europe, our sailors and explorers tell us of great lands far off to our west that are ripe for settlement. Seeing as we need many of our own soldiers and peasants here in the mainland though, we should set up trading colonies instead so that we use less manpower in them and can more easily find profit within the land itself. Perhaps the natives will even join our efforts if they see more as traders and merchants instead of foreigners who want to take their land."
 the_army_reflects_our_developments: "The Culmination of French Development"
 the_army_reflects_our_developments_desc: "Over the centuries of turmoil and struggle, France has emerged as a stable and strong power in Western Europe that can balance out the others nearby. Whether it is the Holy Roman Empire, Iberian upstarts, English rivals, or even Italian dissidents, we have cultivated a strong and enduring state with a constantly evolving military by its side, ready for anything that may come forth. Traditions may guide us into the future, but the path we tread on is also being built by our own expertise, especially when it comes to warfare."
 defenses_on_our_mainland: "Mainland Defensive Networks"
 defenses_on_our_mainland_desc: "With how warfare is changing to incorporate larger cannons and more accurate muskets into the mix of things, the old defensive fortifications we have are not going to stand up for long in a drawn out war. We must come up with a stronger defensive strategy and build a network of defenses throughout mainland France so that communication between them is easier than before and so that they can withstand artillery fire. If this means we need to rebuild some fortresses from the ground up, then so be it."
 staying_power_of_france: "French Staying Power"
 staying_power_of_france_desc: "A state such as ours is rare for Europe to see, is it not? A state that has lasted for more than 500 years in some form or another and can still be called one of the leading powers in Europe with an administration and military that are perhaps some of the most refined in comparison to other powers in Europe. The enduring traditions of France are something to be truly proud of, and as our military march to defend French interests in both European lands and far off colonies, they go forth knowing they are the apex of the French power. The spirit of France lives on!"

 #Bremen Ideas#
 vorde_castle_at_our_heart: "Residence at Vorde Castle"
 vorde_castle_at_our_heart_desc: "Vorde Castle is the main residence for the Prince-Archbishop of Bremen. The city of Bremen itself may be the seat of the chapter and Basdahl may be our venue for diets of the state, but Vorde Castle remains as a stalwart seat of governance that is well defended and well maintained. Emulating it's defensive construction elsewhere with what funds we have will further our defensive posture and make it harder for our lands to be seized in the future."
 religious_politics_of_archdiocese_bremen: "Religious Politics Never Cease"
 religious_politics_of_archdiocese_bremen_desc: "Whether we are dealing with heretics or people of the true faith, the religious politics of our region are always ensuring that our Prince-Archbishop and those around him are on their feet, ready for what comes next. The politics we have before us can become violent, bloody, and even lead us toward paths we never thought were possible before, but whatever happens inside our archdiocese, it will deepen our devotion to our faith and we will ensure that the outcomes help cement trust from our citizens rather than make them fear that instability is rife in the administration."
 the_gelnhausen_privilege: "The Gelnhausen Privilege"
 the_gelnhausen_privilege_desc: "When we were recognized as a unique political body under the Gelnhausen Privilege in 1186 by Emperor Frederick I, Bremen became less attached to the Papacy in terms of political sway and control. Catholicism is still deeply rooted in Bremen, sure, but the Gelnhausen Privilege issued to Bishop Hartwig II provided us with more centralized political control whilst also being under the close watch of the leader of the Holy Roman Empire."
 push_and_pull_of_estate_power: "Contention in Bremen's Politics"
 push_and_pull_of_estate_power_desc: "The politics of Bremen are complex to say the least, be they religious in nature or not. Various outside dynasties try to have sway in our land, estates try to get their petitions put into law, and the Prince-Archbishop attempts to centralize power underneath themselves in defiance of the estates. This causes a great deal of tension that we know all too well, but it also helps stoke innovation in the minds of several officials and advisors who seek new ways of passing legislation and governing the land properly."
 reputation_as_an_imperial_immediacy: "Imperial Immediacy"
 reputation_as_an_imperial_immediacy_desc: "Being of imperial immediacy is quite beneficial to Bremen as it allows us a number of rights that other duchies and states in the Holy Roman Empire do not have. Though this has meant that Bremen is subject more to the emperor's will as opposed to states that do not hold imperial immediacy, this history behind us gives us quite the reputation around Europe."
 victims_of_outside_supremacy_no_more: "Militarize the Prince-Archbishopric"
 victims_of_outside_supremacy_no_more_desc: "The position of Bremen geographically means it is vulnerable to a variety of threats from many sides, especially if we cannot control the sea during times of war. This needs to change in the future if Bremen is to survive as an independent entity, and to do this we will first need to build up a formal military force beyond that of just forces that can assist the emperor."
 patriarchate_of_the_north_ambition: "Adalbert of Hamburg's Old Ambition"
 patriarchate_of_the_north_ambition_desc: "Back when we were still lumped together under the 'Archdiocese of Hamburg-Bremen', Archbishop Adalbert of Hamburg (1000-1072) was perhaps the most influential figure for the time period for us. He had supremacy over the Scandinavian peninsula, lands that were held by the Wends at the time, and also all territory north of the Elbe River. He strived to increase the influence of his archbishopric as much as possible to have it reign as the supreme archdiocese in the far north, though he failed to see this ambition through. Despite our poor luck in the past with politics and military conflicts, we can still strive to see this old ambition through to the end."

 #Hessian Ideas#
 split_apart_and_reunited: "Putting Hesse Back Together"
 split_apart_and_reunited_desc: "Hesse has been divided into Upper Hesse and Lower Hesse several times before because of inheritance laws that we follow. Despite the perils this has caused the House of Hesse, it has given our house members ample training in fabricating and pressing claims on territory some might not traditionally see as Hessian in nature. Refining this skill of fabricating claims will only help Hesse grow over time."
 hesses_place_in_the_reformation: "Our Answer to the Reformation is..."
 hesses_place_in_the_reformation_desc: "The Protestant Reformation is spreading rapidly across Central Europe and the Holy Roman Empire is in the very heart of it. Hesse has seen a great many Protestant and Calvinist proponents since the start of this new era of religious strife, yet there are still some in our lands who stand firmly by the side of the Papacy and the Counter-Reformation. Perhaps we should give each side a listen? The Protestants and others seem to have quite a uniquely interesting view on the Bible and traditional Catholic doctrine as it is..."
 marburg_for_theologians: "Found the University of Marburg"
 marburg_for_theologians_desc: "Despite the religious turmoil spread across Europe, Marburg has become a sort of central hub for theologians and scholars of philosophy. Investing into the local infrastructure and setting up a good university fit for fostering religious debate and philosophical thought would do Hesse nicely as it continues to grow and evolve alongside the shifting tides of religion. Perhaps even we can be at the center of innovative ideas in time, or maybe we can help shape some new religious doctrines for ourselves and others."
 leagues_upon_leagues_in_the_hre: "Constant Fighting of Leagues"
 leagues_upon_leagues_in_the_hre_desc: "Leagues of small states to fight for a common cause is not uncommon inside the Holy Roman Empire. It is hard to distinguish a time when there wasn't a public league of some kind that tested the will of the leader of the empire, and we of Hesse have been around to witness quite a few of the historic leagues. In time, we might even join some new leagues and go to war for what we think is righteous and just, and if Hesse gets involved in such affairs, our troops will be motivate firmly to our side of the cause."
 hessian_guns_for_hire: "Providing Contracts and Soldiers"
 hessian_guns_for_hire_desc: "Hesse has not been in the greatest position in the Holy Roman Empire. Taking new land is hard, fighting on our level is ruthless and decisive after just a few months, and we always need to be mindful about what the Holy Roman Emperor might say about our moves. It would be much easier if we just start hiring our soldiers off to other states who are currently fighting so that they stay well trained and fit for service whilst we retain the extra martial capabilities and experiences they bring back."
 moving_of_people_in_central_europe: "Migrations Everywhere"
 moving_of_people_in_central_europe_desc: "The Protestant Reformation has brought about a great many communities being burned to the ground and a great many people moving to new lands in search of religious toleration. Whilst our policy on tolerance is something else, we are more than happy to receive people of the true faith as they can do well in the Hessian military. We can strengthen their fealty toward Hesse in general once they're integrated into Hessian society or the Hessian military, either one will do."
 sharpening_stone_of_religious_war: "Sharpening the Hessian Armory"
 sharpening_stone_of_religious_war_desc: "The decades of warfare in Central Europe that we've come to witness and participate in has helped imbue the military of Hesse with an ongoing martial tradition unlike many others in Europe. Whilst we are not the most seasoned and well-trained military, nor are we the largest one out there in comparison to powers like the Ottoman Empire or France, Hesse can still punch above its weight in a pitched battle and the discipline its troops show is nothing to laugh at. Our forces show the fruits of discipline and martial prowess; of quality of quantity."

 #Mexico Ideas#
 amidst_smoke_and_ashes: "As the Dust Settles..."
 amidst_smoke_and_ashes_desc: "Fighting has been done all across our nation from the start of the revolution to its end with blood, dust, and ashes scattered everywhere. There are so many pieces to pick up as we trudge forward into the future, but our spirit is unwavering and our people are united in their cause. We will rebuild and we will remain as one!"
 mesoamericans_of_mexico: "... Mexico Stands Tall!"
 mesoamericans_of_mexico_desc: "And even as we begin to rebuild, there are those who question about the position of natives like the Aztecs, the Zapotecs, and the Chichimeca, what place do they have in Mexico? Well we have no choice but to integrate them into Mexico itself, accepting their populations into the fold and doing what we can to reconcile differences here and there. Mexico can stand tall in this world beyond Europe, united with its indigenous people against former colonial overlords."
 land_grants_redone: "Reformation of Land Grants"
 land_grants_redone_desc: "The former system of land grants and distributing various plots of land in general is not going to suit Mexico for the future. A staunch overhaul of the entire system is in order so that our economy and administration can function in a more streamlined way, but it will take many years to do this. Thankfully as this goes into effect, it will drive more innovative ways of thinking about how to both distribute land and how to make it productive."
 the_other_rebellion: "The 'Other' Rebellions"
 the_other_rebellion_desc: "Throughout our period of revolution against our former overlords, the indigenous people of the land did stage their own small-scale rebellions aimed at re-establishing independent native polities. These 'other' rebellions gave us valuable experience in a variety of combat conditions meaning that our more elite regiments will know just how to handle such terrain in the future."
 ordinary_people_part_of_the_revolution: "Support from Commoners"
 ordinary_people_part_of_the_revolution_desc: "What many from the outside do not understand about our revolution is why so many peasants and commoners joined in. It did mean that the overall quality of our troops were lower, but the sheer mass of armed soldiers we could put forth was something to truly behold. Our peasant class of people have not forgotten what they fought for and are always willing to take up arms again should they need to dethrone a tyrannical government."
 from_insurgency_to_revolution: "From Insurgency to Revolution"
 from_insurgency_to_revolution_desc: "Another key facet of our revolution was the fact that we had insurgents all across the region. They helped inform regiments about where enemy troops planned to go, how the enemy were going to strike, and even how the enemies were going to be supplied from beyond the coast. Calling upon these insurgents again can ensure the safety of Mexico's independence in the future, and it can also help draw more support for our military if we ever need more than what we currently have."
 what_legacy_does_mexico_have: "Debates on our Future"
 what_legacy_does_mexico_have_desc: "The legacy that we of Mexico hold is shrouded in fog: is it a legacy of imperial conquest? Of upholding republican values? Is there perhaps a third alternative to these two paths? Whatever we find laying beyond the dense fog, we will ensure that Mexico's diverse array of people are represented well so that they can do here what they could not do under the authority of their former overlords in regards to instituting fair and just legislation."

With its name meaning roughly 'the fortress of the Britons', it and also being able to support a sizable naval fleet nearby, Dumbarton Castle will forever serve as an example of the fortitude and power of our land."

 the_crux_of_fighting_for_three_sides_desc: "These islands to the north that we call home are all claimed by three groups of people besides ourselves: The Scots of the Highlands, the Irish, and the Norse from the far east. Over the centuries we have had claims on our land pressed so that certain individuals may succeed or fail in certain capacities, yet all of these claims just make things all the more clear for us: the history of these fair islands is nothing but old claims and being caught between larger powers. It is time we capitalize on all this bickering and scheming and press what claims we have!"
 clans_of_the_isles: "The Clans of the Isles"
 clans_of_the_isles_desc: "Our land is the origin place of a fair few clans scattered throughout, from Clan MacDougall to Clan Ruaidhri. Whilst we cannot hope to rein in every single member of these clans back to our islands, we can use what connections we have with them to recruit strong and capable fighters for our military. Not only this, but we could also possibly enlist a fair few sailors out of these clans since we are situated in an area where knowing how to sail is vital to survival."
 norse_blood_of_these_islands: "Norse Heritage"
 norse_blood_of_these_islands_desc: "Norse people are not entirely gone from our land but their numbers are slowly declining as a whole. Despite this, our blood is still intertwined with that of Norse folks who sailed to these islands and conquered them for their own benefit centuries ago. Their mighty sailing capabilities and prowess on the high seas is what we should strive to emulate as we continue to build ourselves up."
 refine_the_ounceland_system: "The Ounceland System Redone"
 refine_the_ounceland_system_desc: "The traditional unit of land measurement in our region has been that of the Ounceland. It is based on the rent paid instead of actual land area and has been around for many generations, but we cannot help but start to identify flaws in the system that could be refined if we put enough effort into the matter. Perhaps we could extract more out of our land if we pass new legislation and attempt to come up with a new version of the ounceland system."
 hardened_over_generations: "Consistent Hardship"
 hardened_over_generations_desc: "It is without question that these islands that we call home have been subjected to hardship after hardship over the decades as many wars and conflicts have been fought over who owns what and what clans should be in charge of which islands. We bear the scars of these past conflicts in broad daylight, showing all around us that we will not be put down so easily and that we will endure until the very end."

 fleet_of_the_northern_lands_desc: "And once we have secured for ourselves a steady independent state that is free from constant threats at our livelihood, a glorious and grand fleet shall grace the waters of the North Sea! That fleet will be built by and for the Kingdom of the Isles, letting all around us know that we can truly challenge any power that threatens us."

 that_this_realm_of_england_is_an_empire_desc: "We have come a very long way in regards to our origins. These fair isles are a mix of cultures dating back to the days of Celtic people, Anglo-Saxon settlers, and Norse raiders, but at the end of it all we have come together to organize our people into a formal empire, one that can rule unmatched amounts of land compared to entities from the past."

 listening_to_the_west_country_men_desc: "A variety of people from the West Country, that of the southwestern portion of mainland England, are looking to endorse and fund our expansionist efforts. Several noted admirals and advisors are willing to serve our interest both out on the high seas and in lands close to home, promoting the identity of Great Britain as a whole and propagating its power in the vast trade routes of Atlantic Ocean. Listening to the advice these people have to offer will only help us more in the future."

 privateer_and_propagate_power_desc: "Whether it is through strict colonial organization or ensuring that taxes and tariffs are properly followed and collected, we must ensure that British influence spreads by any and all means. Sometimes it is through shady channels that some would find questionable, other times it is through proud and majestic endeavors, yet every single time we will strive to have our actions increase our reach in the world at large."

 lessons_of_a_new_model_army_desc: "The days of feudal levies and calling upon loyal nobles for service are declining; we are having to rely more and more on new ways of organizing our own military so that the empire is held together and defended properly. If we can begin to modernize our military and start up a system to professionalize those who choose to serve over time, we'll be able to keep up the pace with regards to military might. The French, Spanish, German princes, and even Italian states are sure to do this as well, meaning we will surely be evenly matched."
 reformation_of_redcoat_regiments: "Redcoats, Stand Firm"
 reformation_of_redcoat_regiments_desc: "The characteristic garb of our soldiers is increasingly becoming the red coats that they wear for service and ceremonies. Not only this, but the ever evolving military doctrines we are putting into place is giving our soldiers in red coats a distinct edge in battle since we have been open to embracing this new era of gunpowder weaponry. Making the red coats a standard in our regiments and ensuring they can flexibly follow instructions with muskets always at the ready will help bolster our overall military capability."

 refitting_the_royal_navy_desc: "What is an empire like ours if it doesn't have a proper navy to protect its shores? We are an island nation after all! Royalty like us and our great empire needs a truly royal navy and we will outfit ours with the smartest and most capable sailors we can find, alongside the strongest ship designs we can muster. The many pieces of our domain will be protected no matter what sort of enemy seeks to intrude on our plans."
 the_move_toward_abolitionism: "Enslaving Violates the Rights of Man"
 the_move_toward_abolitionism_desc: "Though we have been engaged in it prior to today, the slave trade is increasingly becoming a tense issue inside our empire. The people of Great Britain, especially the scholars and advisors close to the heart of power, are raising questions as to how morally right it is to be enslaving people despite them being of a different skin color and of a different language. They are human too, are they not? They deserve rights like any other man, do they not? This notion of abolitionism isn't going to stop anytime soon in our empire, so perhaps it is time we fully look into the matter and make a just and righteous judgement."

Our rivals in Venice know of our glory as well and they have coveted it for decades just like we covet their glory, yet our time in the sun is far from over. Genoa must keep pressing forward with its dutiful and grand navy guiding the way; we, the 'la Dominant dei mari' (the Dominant of the Seas), 'la Superba' (the Superb one), and the 'la Repubblica dei magnifici' (the Republic of the Magnificents), will be the one that encompasses all of the Mediterranean!"
 old_byzantine_trade_ties: "Byzantine Connections"
 old_byzantine_trade_ties_desc: "Old connections from when the Byzantine Empire was still a grand power in the east are around, even though Turkish traders and merchants have taken the place of Byzantine ones. Genoa's influence in the Aegean Sea remains there even after all this time has passed, though it is on the cusp of falling into disarray if we cannot maintain a good fleet nor good income. If we can manage to cement our hold over Lesbos, Azov, and our other territories in the east, then we can capitalize off of what old Byzantine trade ties we have still."
 providing_credit_to_others: "Credit where Credit is Needed"
 providing_credit_to_others_desc: "As politics continue to rumble around in the Holy Roman Empire to our north, various princes, bishops, and sometimes even emperors need sources of credit and funds for their campaigns both in the political and military realm. We of Genoa are all too eager to offer credit in these circumstances since we can profit off of these deals later, we just have to remember to learn from when these credit deals turn sour so that we can improve our methods of financing."
 genoese_banking: "Genoese Banking Endeavors"
 genoese_banking_desc: "Perhaps one of the oldest banks in the world is found within Genoa, that which is called the Bank of Saint George. Founded in 1407 and still running now, it is a testament to our will to continue our banking prospects even as other states around us invest into banking as a whole. What makes us stand out in the respect is just how efficient our methods of banking are and how much fortune our noble families have amassed. These two aspects in tandem with each other gives Genoese banks the fuel they need to assess and evaluate economic matters in manner unmatched by anyone else, and it will help Genoa become one of the banking centers in Europe."
 indirect_genoese_governance: "Indirect Authority"
 indirect_genoese_governance_desc: "The nature of the Genoese state means that it does not have the power to govern its lands to the east and beyond Corsica in a direct manner. We have relied heavily on indirect governance methods for a long while and it has worked for us so far, but we are soon going to feel the strain that is keeping up with maintaining these far off lands underneath our decentralized way of governing. On the plus side, it does mean that Genoa can rule over more land as a whole as compared to other states around us."

 venetian_conflicts_desc: "Venice is undoubtedly our largest rival. Whether it is at foreign markets or along the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, the ships and merchants from Venice plague the power that stems from Genoa without end. We must not lose hope though, for we know that we can beat Venice eventually if we calculate our moves out and ally the right states against Venice. Our fleets will fit for any major clash at sea as well since we are actively learning from our defeats before and improving upon our naval tactics as the years go by."
 the_genoese_arsenal: "An Arsenal for Genoa"
 the_genoese_arsenal_desc: "The Venetian Arsenal is something we do not like to be jealous of, but we cannot help ourselves in this manner. It is famous for its ability to produce ships at an amazing rate, serving to prop up the Venetian fleet time and time again. Though we cannot have the arsenal directly, perhaps we can start building our own arsenal for Genoa and concentrate funds toward obtaining engineers and builders who know exactly what they are doing with regards to building ships for trade and war. If we eclipse Venice in the future, we might even be able to dismantle their arsenal and make ours the only one in all of Europe."

 #American Ideas#
 delegation_of_powers: "Delegate Central Authority"
 delegation_of_powers_desc: "Our former overlords were far too fond of central authority and placing it in the hands of either one person or just a few highly valued people. We must delegate some of these powers once entrusted to monarchs and advisors of said monarchs to specific branches of government. Once we have formulated said branches of government, we will be able to more effectively scrutinize incoming legislation and refine it before it is put into law."
 liberal_republican_outlook: "Above the Ideas of Monarchy"
 liberal_republican_outlook_desc: "In many ways we find the ideas of old monarchies to be archaic and ill-suited for the people of the United States of America. We can clearly see the ideas of this age and what they espouse as being rational in a variety of ways, and when compared to old traditions that our former overlords clung to, these liberal and republican ideas are better in almost every way at representing the people of this land fairly and justly."
 managing_imports_and_exports: "Balance Imports vs. Exports"
 managing_imports_and_exports_desc: "The coast of our up-and-coming state is vast, open to invasion and also open to a variety of trade routes. We would do well to take control of coastal areas through settlements and enforce more authority over both imports and exports so that we can reduce the chance of smugglers getting through whilst also helping encourage domestic trade between states along the coast. There are goods in the north that just aren't found in the south and vice versa."
 poential_states_for_statehood: "Accepting New States"
 poential_states_for_statehood_desc: "New land we acquire through settling new towns and villages on the frontier can quickly balloon in population size. Fertile and open land are especially popular with American families and thus, we are going to get fairly rapid settlements as the years go by. Now, we can give land grants fairly easily but we processing applications for statehood takes months to go through, meaning we need to formalize the process over the coming decades and ensure that states can have solid borders and a firm place in our nation."
 overarching_unifying_identity: "Unity Amongst the Varied States"
 overarching_unifying_identity_desc: "Our nation is not a nation of one single people. We have folks from all different walks of life that is true, but it is also true that we have folks from various cultural backgrounds and they can contribute to tensions inside these United States if we let them go unheard. We should instead strive to listen to what they have to say, and strive to give them representation in our government so that they feel and know their voices are heard."
 militia_to_continental_to_legion_to_army: "Transitions of the Military"
 militia_to_continental_to_legion_to_army_desc: "The military we used to get where we are was hardly a formal military force in comparison to our former overlords. From the days of being town-oriented militias to being something of a true standing army for these United States of America, we are well on our way to organizing a robust military that can protect the liberties we fought for."
 move_toward_freedom_of_religion: "Let Other Faiths Speak Freely"
 move_toward_freedom_of_religion_desc: "Religion is a tense subject inside our borders but we have a strong inclination toward being indifferent to religion as a whole. Many vouch for freedom of religion in our land, but there are strong religious communities and strongly religious officials in our government who refuse to let go of having a state-enforced religion. In this context we must work ever so slowly toward separating our politics from our personal religion; this is a land of liberty and freedom, not of religious conformity."

 #Welsh Ideas#
 rhodri_and_the_black_gentiles: "Rhodri and the Black Gentiles"
 rhodri_and_the_black_gentiles_desc: "Rhodri ap Merfyn was 'King of the Britons' according to the Annals of Ulster and through our own records, Rhodri attained a great deal of success for Gwynedd. He annexed Powys and Seisyllwg whilst also holding off invasions from vikings (called 'Black Gentiles' in our old sources), all of which gave a solid foundation for the coming Kingdom of Gwynedd. His military deeds and willingness to defend the Welsh people and their lands from invasions will forever be remembered, and he will be known as one of the greatest rulers in all of Welsh history."
 chronicle_of_the_princes_and_more: "Brut y Tywysogion"
 chronicle_of_the_princes_and_more_desc: "Brut y Tywysogion, or, the Chronicle of the Princes, is one of the finest and greatest sources of Welsh history that we have with us. It details the deaths of certain important figures, when eclipses happened, when plagues struck, and even events relating to religion in Welsh lands. Though some of our literary tradition has faded since the English annexed our land, we can still bring back the grandeur of Welsh literature and oral tradition for the future; we no longer have the English yoke over us and thus no longer have to abide by their demeaning laws."
 commonality_between_gwynedd_pwys_deheubarth: "Gwynedd, Powys, and Deheubarth"
 commonality_between_gwynedd_pwys_deheubarth_desc: "The three principle places of Wales that held historical prominence to us of today are Gwynedd, Powys, and Deheubarth. There were a great number of succession disputes and battles that took place in the lands of all three, yet Welsh people from all three lands came together time and time again to revolt against encroaching English authority in centuries past. We need to focus on this unifying identity of Wales and break down small community barriers so that we can be stronger and more robust internally, since exploiting internal Welsh feuds has historically been what the English did."
 eliminate_succession_questions: "Affirm Reformed Succession Laws"
 eliminate_succession_questions_desc: "The succession to power in Welsh lands has always been a tricky thing. Family members feel jealous that they did not get a cut of power or they are acting upon false information that ends up causing untold amounts of damage, all of this ends up hurting Wales internally and making it vulnerable to external influences. By refining our succession laws and ensuring that our heir is affirmed by multiple family members and court members, Wales can finally solve its internal disputes and do away with petty claims to the throne."
 celtic_christianitys_legacy: "Celtic Christianity"
 celtic_christianitys_legacy_desc: "The influences of Christianity in Wales are plain for all to see, but so are the influences from how Wales was before Christianity arrived. This sort of Celtic Christianity that developed in Wales and in other places nearby held slightly different views and laws that were not in line with laws set out by the Papacy, meaning that Celtic Christianity was in a sense more open to different views. At the same time, Celtic Christianity was shaped by Welsh people and being very community oriented made for a distinct form of Christianity that could identify foreigners to the subset faith fairly easily."
 regularize_welsh_yeoman: "Regularize the Yeomanry"
 regularize_welsh_yeoman_desc: "Yeoman have been in usage in England for quite some time and Welsh people have historically held the title of 'yeoman' in a variety of places throughout England, but what set Welsh folks apart from English yeoman was the increased usage of the longbow. Though the longbow is being phased out of usage, the Welsh yeoman population are still capable of military combat and should be formalized as time goes on. Giving them proper training and transitioning them to proper gunpowder weaponry with enough discipline will make the Welsh yeomanry a truly grand force."
 economic_independence_of_wales: "Economic Independence"
 economic_independence_of_wales_desc: "Another avenue of exploitation that the English used against us was in the way of the Welsh economy. We produce quite a few things like cattle, timber, horses, wax, cheese, and flannel, but we have historically impomrtated salt, wine, and wheat from places like London and Paris. Thus, the English could easily exploit us when they needed to, but now we are in a position to fight back! We have the measures to obtain true economic independence from the English and in time, we can even outclass them in the production of certain materials and resources. All of this relies on our efforts from here on out."

 ger_unification_of_german_people: "Unity Amongst German People"
 ger_unification_of_german_people_desc: "For too many ages, eras, and centuries the German people have been split apart into various tribes, princedoms, republican states, and also theocratic states. This time of uniting the German people into a singular state with new traditions and ideas at our disposal will prove to be a pivotal time for us. Through our actions here in this coming era of German unification, others around us will know the true power that lies within a German state that has broken down the petty barriers between the various groups such as Saxons, Bavarians, Swabians, and every other Germanic people."
 ger_authentic_military_traditions: "Culmination of Militaristic Traditions"
 ger_authentic_military_traditions_desc: "From the age of battling against the Roman Empire to the age of founding the Holy Roman Empire to the age of gunpowder weaponry making its way into European military strategy, the various people of Germany have been well versed in military matters regardless of where they are located. The German state we have cultivated can and will be the ultimate culmination of this extensive military tradition, and we will perfect the usage of gunpowder weapons both large and small in the field of battle."
 ger_iron_and_coal: "Industrial Might Rising"
 ger_iron_and_coal_desc: "The various lands we control in Central Europe are fertile with veins of coal and iron, but until recently both resources have been relatively hard to utilize on an industrial scale; mining, extracting, and refining these raw resources into more usable material just takes resources that previous German states could not muster up on their own. In our current state though, we have the financial power and the administrative power to start strong coal and iron industries throughout Germany. It will be through these industries that we will bring Germany into the industrial age! And it will be an age that we will come to call our own!"

 hab_concentrated_german_banking: "Concentrated German Banking"
 hab_concentrated_german_banking_desc: "Our foundations in German banking has never been in doubt. The Fuggers and Welsers have funded a great many projects in our land whilst bringing prosperity to the various German cities all throughout Central Europe. Not only this though, but the German banking families have helped us in regards to getting certain royal family members into key positions of power which goes to show just how influential and smart they can be. The more we can rely on them as opposed to foreign bankers, the better off we will be."
 hab_court_of_the_habsburgs: "The Grandeur of our Court"
 hab_court_of_the_habsburgs_desc: "The roots of our state are colored by the fact that diplomacy and marriages were just as key to our rise to power as military endeavors were, perhaps more so than other states around us. Thus, we rightfully take pride in the fact that our royal family is both desirable and influential in lands well beyond our current borders. The more we spread out and influence other nations through bonds of blood, the better off we will be."
 hab_holder_of_imperial_authority: "Imperial Splendor"
 hab_holder_of_imperial_authority_desc: "The Holy Roman Empire was an... Interesting experiment, let us say that much for now. Leading the Holy Roman Empire is something few are capable of doing, but the Austrian people proved to be the ones who were most capable of securing the position as emperor and sustaining it throughout time. It is these Austrian roots of ours and the reputation we have of keeping the throne of the Holy Roman Empire in our realm that helps give us diplomatic prominence."
 hab_routine_frontier_contacts: "Encounters at our Borders"
 hab_routine_frontier_contacts_desc: "It is never easy at the borders of a united German state like ours, yet our military is more versed in this matter than others would think. Austrians have traditionally been at the fringes of Germanic culture in the southeast, bordering the Magyars to the east, the Italians to the south, and the Balkan states in the southeast. So what does this long frontier do for our military personnel? It trains them over time and allows us to enforce more strict borders that are in our favor."

 frc_reversing_the_kleinstaaterei: "Reversal of the Fragmentation"
 frc_reversing_the_kleinstaaterei_desc: "In the centuries of the past, the Holy Roman Empire was the site of and the vehicle in which several once prominent Stem Duchies declined and fragmented into feuding princes and warring states. Now that the Franconian people have transcended these antiquated lines in the sand that were once drawn by petty dukes and bishops, we can promote a policy of harmonious assimilation of people we take into this new German state we have crafted. Taking in these fragmented states into our fold has been quite the task as it is, why should this history of ours not help shape our policy of expansion?"
 frc_strategic_usage_of_robber_barons: "Strategies with Robber Barons"
 frc_strategic_usage_of_robber_barons_desc: "People such as the infamous Eppelein von Gailingen of Middle Franconia are known as robber barons. They have plagued certain parts of the Holy Roman Empire in the past and even in our up-and-coming German state they are not unheard of since chivalrous knights of old who no longer have traditional work turn to the work of being robber barons. We have our work cut out for us to keep the ones inside our state at bay, but perhaps we can make deals with robber barons in neighboring areas just outside of German lands where lucrative trade routes cross into rural and unprotected land held by our rivals. It may be an underhanded tactic, but one that can easily net Germany a hefty amount of trade income."
 frc_centralized_franconian_circle_power: "Evolution of the Franconian Circle"
 frc_centralized_franconian_circle_power_desc: "The Franconian Circle of the Holy Roman Empire is no longer around in an official sense, but it helped cement the foundation for our rise to power and also helped solidify the resolve of many Franconian officials in the past. It is thanks to the foundations of the Franconian Circle that we have the military strength that we do, and also the capability of expanding our land forces through the development of regimental towns and organization."
 frc_come_to_terms_with_commoners: "German People of All Classes"
 frc_come_to_terms_with_commoners_desc: "The ages of time have not been the kindest to Franconian people nor the large states that German people have tried to cultivate in the past. Despite the odds against us though, we have managed to overcome the barriers in regards to state unification for the German people meaning that we can address issues in regards to the various social classes in a much more direct way. Whether they are issues concerning nobles of great status, merchants of various guilds, clergy of the various Christian denominations, or even commoners who work the vital farmlands of Germany, we will hear them all and reduce the desire to stir unrest throughout all of Germany."

 sax_reclaimed_glory_of_saxony: "Lost Glory, Found"
 sax_reclaimed_glory_of_saxony_desc: "Not since the Stem Duchy of Saxony and the early days of the Electorate of Saxony did the Saxon people have so much prestige amongst other German speaking people. Finally after so many conflicts and deals have the Saxon people been able to do what so many have strived for: unification of the Germans throughout all of Central Europe. Such a momentous occasion is symbolic to many and is seen as almost succeeding where the Stem Duchy of Saxony left off so long ago."
 sax_upper_and_lower_saxons: "Strength of the Saxon People"
 sax_upper_and_lower_saxons_desc: "Saxon people have played a crucial role in a myriad of politics concerning German states in the past and that is going to be no different as we go forward. Holding the strongest amount of power in Germany as of now and bringing a grandiose age of unity to these fair lands, it should be no surprise that Saxons from all walks of life are willing to defend what we have cultivated so far, much more so than Austrians, Bavarians, or even Franconians."
 sax_perfection_of_architecture: "Perfecting Architecture"
 sax_perfection_of_architecture_desc: "Many styles of architecture are around in Germany, but it is in the northern parts where Saxon people make themselves at home alongside Pomeranians and Westphalians that we see architecture reaching its absolute apex. Whether it is in the work of great cathedrals or in the intricate details of the sprawling castles of our land, we are always striving to perfect our architecture as time goes on. As we do so, we'll be able to attract bright minds from all across Europe and also refine just how exactly we build these structures."
 sax_strive_for_innovative_thought: "Innovation in German Minds"
 sax_strive_for_innovative_thought_desc: "Saxon land in the north has been seen by many as the heart of the Protestant Reformation and indeed it is this region that has bred many innovative minds with regards to philosophers and theologians. Cultivating this mindset and being open to new ideas instead of closing our doors to them should be what Germany strives for since such new concepts and bold claims could lead to radical discoveries that change the way we think about key matters."

 bav_quality_over_quantity: "German Quality"
 bav_quality_over_quantity_desc: "We Germans have usually sided with the quality side of things instead of the quantity side when it comes to a variety of matters, but this is no more clear than in our military structure. We focus on the discipline and merit of individual regiments and officers so as to ensure the staying power of our forces on the field of battle whilst also projecting the influence of Germany in the various conflicts we are involved in."
 bav_let_the_music_flow: "Let the Music Flow!"
 bav_let_the_music_flow_desc: "The Renaissance brought with it a plethora of wonderful innovations in the fields of philosophy, theology, natural science, and even music making. The subject of music making has been especially present in our core lands of Bavaria for some time and it is because of the foundation set up by the Renaissance that various Bavarian orchestras and composers have become famous all across Europe. Cultivating this musical tradition will grant us not only a lasting legacy far into the future, but it will also attract a great number of famous scholars and officials to our land."
 bav_stringent_production_regulations: "Regulations on Production"
 bav_stringent_production_regulations_desc: "Whether it is producing beer or producing gunpowder, we are keen on regulating the production methods in Germany due to the fact that we have witnessed what can happen when markets without regulation spiral out of control. Economic hardships as a result of unregulated markets is what we will avoid at all costs and the heartland of Bavaria in Germany will be the shining example of what an economy with firm and clear regulations can do."
 bav_reformation_of_holy_order_ranks: "Transition the Holy Orders"
 bav_reformation_of_holy_order_ranks_desc: "Age-old orders dedicated to the Catholic faith are finding themselves without purpose and without work as time goes on. Germany houses a fair few sectors of holy orders but increasingly they are becoming restless due to the age of religious wars being well and truly over. Perhaps we can set up a sort of administrative sector that can help transition these warriors of the faith toward a regular military career, for if we are able to do so, we will have the stalwart backing of courageous fighters that come from hallowed ancestry."

 pom_our_northern_ports: "Great Northern Ports"
 pom_our_northern_ports_desc: "Places in the north like Oldenburg, Hamburg, Lubeck, Rugen, and Stettin are where the majority of German sailors and traders come from as the maritime tradition of the north has had a strong influence on both politics and diplomacy. Emphasizing these northern ports and building up our naval prominence will help encourage merchants to come to our safe coastal cities and build them up to being economic centers."
 pom_focus_on_northern_trade: "Focus on Northern Trade"
 pom_focus_on_northern_trade_desc: "Historically the German people have rarely had homes in the south that bordered any sort of coast, thus not allowing us access to Mediterranean trade overall. The north, though, especially in the Baltic Sea, is where German people have been able to contest the likes of Scandinavians and Russians, so why would we not focus our mercantile matters here? Sharpening our metaphorical mercantile blade against our cultural neighbors will only breed German dominance in the markets of Europe."
 pom_defense_against_scandinavians: "Scandinavian Incursions"
 pom_defense_against_scandinavians_desc: "The greatest foreign rival to northern merchants and small German states like Wolgast, Rugen, and Mecklenburg has been the Scandinavian people. Denmark and Sweden in particular have skirmished with Pomeranian traders frequently over the centuries, meaning that Pomeranians are especially versed in how to deal with Scandinavian fleets. Perhaps if we eclipse our northern rivals in terms of naval strength, we can bring about a more efficient trade sector stemming from the Baltic Sea."
 pom_unparalleled_mercantile_dominance: "Silver, Gold, and Fiscal Responsibility"
 pom_unparalleled_mercantile_dominance_desc: "The combination of German banking with German mercantile methods is something that make European markets and trade centers the economic envy of the entire world. It will be a long road to get to this point since German banking is actively developing and the merchants of our land need to be worked with over time, but if we are consistent in this regard and set up the German economy to be oriented toward harnessing the power of cross-continental trade, Germany will be an unstoppable economic power."

 rhn_to_cross_the_rhine_river: "The Rhine River Crossings"
 rhn_to_cross_the_rhine_river_desc: "The mighty Rhine River is the river by which many communities make their living, and it is also the river where several battles in history have been decided. Germans and French people know the significance of this grand river all too well, and since it is in our control, we can practice crossing it routinely with our soldiers so that they know exactly what to do should they face a battle that involves any sort of river crossing."
 rhn_electorates_and_free_cities: "Legacy of Imperial States"
 rhn_electorates_and_free_cities_desc: "From electorates to free cities, the Rhenish people have held several grandiose positions of power in the Holy Roman Empire and have attained a reputation that is hard to surpass. With this in mind and also the fact that diplomacy was key to maintaining the semblance of power in Rhenish lands, we will be able to cultivate a German state that is capable in its diplomacy and in remembering its heritage."
 rhn_the_dreaded_french: "The Dreaded French"
 rhn_the_dreaded_french_desc: "If there has been one issue Germans have always faced since the inception of the Holy Roman Empire, it is the dreaded French. Whether through shrewd politics to adept diplomacy to firm military campaigns, the French have invaded eastward against German people for ages now and we have pushed back just as hard as they pushed against us. And who have always been at the front of these French invasions? The Rhenish people, that is who! Through the experiences the Rhenish people have gone through, we will be ready for whatever the French try to throw at us next!"
 rhn_economic_liberalization: "Liberal Economic Measures"
 rhn_economic_liberalization_desc: "The Rhine River is bountiful in what it gives to German people in terms of prosperity and opportunity. As we begin to cultivate a more financially adept and innovative state, Germany should look to the Rhineland to see how proper urban development should go. From these pivotal cities on the rise, we can make other cities in Germany just as grand in their infrastructure."

 swb_nucleus_of_many_leagues: "Swabian Political Formations"
 swb_nucleus_of_many_leagues_desc: "Several times in the past, Swabians have joined together to form decentralized yet connected leagues and political formations to stand up for what is just in the eyes of Swabians. This history of Swabians attempting to unite together for common political causes is what can help unite other Germans for over-arching political causes, especially in times of war since any threat to our borders is a threat to Germany as a whole. Swabians may be the nucleus of Germany today, but we must bring all Germans together to the common defense of the state."
 swb_numerous_swabian_settlements: "Numerous Swabian Settlements"
 swb_numerous_swabian_settlements_desc: "Swabian people have settled in their respective part of Germany, true, but there are several Swabian settlements in various other parts of Europe. Drawing upon these various Swabian settlements for extended regiments and to help defend parts of Germany is exactly what we should do in the future, and as we recruit from these numerous Swabian settlements they will stand as a patriotic example to other German people groups like Austrians, Rhenish, and Franconians."
 swb_where_opportunity_is_we_are: "Where is the Opportunity?"
 swb_where_opportunity_is_we_are_desc: "Opportunity is abound for Germans all across Europe, but this is also especially true in various parts of Germany. Now that we have broken down the cultural barriers between many of the German speaking people groups, we can extend the opportunities open to Swabians, Austrians, Rhenish, Franconians, and all other German speaking people and concentrate on bolstering our internal economy as well as our centralized administration."
 swb_swabian_financial_centers: "German Economics"
 swb_swabian_financial_centers_desc: "It is not enough that we have strong economic interests and are bold in our economic aspirations, no, we must strive to have true economic centers where banking and finances are taken care of in earnest. Employing the growing class burghers in Germany in respectable financial positions as well as educating our populace on innovative economic theories will help keep Germany on top of Europe's financial matters."

 wst_in_so_many_states: "Epicenter of Vast Power"
 wst_in_so_many_states_desc: "For centuries upon centuries, Germany and its various large cities have been the home of vast amounts of power. They gave their power to a number of states such as East Francia, the Stem Duchies that followed East Francia's fracturing, and of course the Holy Roman Empire, but most of all they can now give their power to a fully united German state. Perhaps the most prosperous cities of all are the Westphalian cities, but even the other cities throughout Germany can contribute to the administration in more ways than one."
 wst_religious_conflict_ends: "End of the Religious Line"
 wst_religious_conflict_ends_desc: "For far too long we've seen religion divide up German states into petty families and communities that spill blood over the slightest of theological differences. What good is this going to do the Westphalian people alongside every other German people group? We must work a neutral ground of sorts, one where we can work religious disputes in the proper theological circles whilst keeping politics separate entirely. It won't be an easy process for Germany, but with enough manpower and official support, we might just be able to rid ourselves of this religious strife."
 wst_attraction_of_cultured_folks: "Cultured German Society"
 wst_attraction_of_cultured_folks_desc: "We may not be as illustrious as the Italian Peninsula in what innovations we come up with, but we certainly have enough bright minds to uphold Germany as a pillar of technological prowess. By focusing our administration toward what Westphalian people have always been geared towad, that being the future and consistent modernization, we will be able to propel Germany to even greater heights."
 wst_route_to_modernization: "A Mind for Modernity"
 wst_route_to_modernization_desc: "Without having a mindset aimed at modernity and what it entails, the rest of the body will be anchored and stuck in the past. This is a fate Germany must never suffer as it is certainly sentencing our state to death by foreign powers encroaching in on a withering corpse. Gearing ourselves toward education and literacy whilst also focusing on building up a meritocratic administration will mean that Germany has what it takes to challenge others across Europe whilst keeping its own politics in check."

 low_look_to_the_globe: "The Global German"
 low_look_to_the_globe_desc: "The Age of Exploration has yielded unprecedented amounts of wealth for those of Western Europe, but us Germans have been left in the dust for far too long! Now that a truly unified German state is at hand without the barriers of the old Holy Roman Empire holding back the German people, we can utilize our great docks in the lands of the Flemish and Frisians to utilize charter companies all across the globe. Truly we do have the capability of being a global German state, we only need the will and strength to do so."
 low_on_land_and_on_the_water: "By Land, and by Sea!"
 low_on_land_and_on_the_water_desc: "As we extend our reach all across the globe, we must have our training camps and shipyards ready for any and every campaign we engage in. Through building up frontier outposts that can become training grounds, and through finding natural harbors that can foster strong settlements of our own people, we will exercise our authority all across the land we see and conquer."
 low_credit_to_germans: "The Spread of Banks"
 low_credit_to_germans_desc: "Banking is such a prominent part of economies now-a-days that it is a marvel that some economies function without the institution. German banking, especially the banking sectors in Flemish and Frisian lands, is of the highest quality in all of Europe and perhaps even the world, thus giving us a distinct advantage in the world of economics. Not only this, but emphasizing the banking sector of these lands in Germany will steer mercantile matters toward them."
 low_a_diamond_in_our_eye: "Unmatched Prominence"
 low_a_diamond_in_our_eye_desc: "To have a mind for diplomacy and trade is one thing, but to cultivate an economy that can reliably depend on both is another. We are doing just such a thing for Germany as a whole, and should our fellow states near and far fail in their economic aspirations or diplomatic endeavors, they can always turn to Germany for assistance in one way or another. So long as these situations help expand our influence elsewhere, we are always willing to help out."

 swi_canton_formalization: "Evolve the Swiss Structure"
 swi_canton_formalization_desc: "Swiss Cantons were always a spectacle to other states in the Holy Roman Empire and those on the outside. None could really emulate our structure of governance and yet, it has given up ample time to know what its strengths and weaknesses are so that we can fix where it falls short and double up on where it excels. In particular this government structure helps instill a strong sense of connected identity that refuses to be broken by even by the strongest of invaders, meaning that when called upon to right cause for all of Germany, we can bring together all German communities and exert unprecedented amounts of force."
 swi_memories_of_mercenaries: "Mercenary Memories"
 swi_memories_of_mercenaries_desc: "The age of mercenary troops dominating the fields of Europe is at an end and professional standing armies are becoming more common because of how technology and societies have changed. German society is moving right along with this change, but we are still affected greatly by how influential the mercenaries of our past were. Perhaps if we are able to obtain new contracts in the future for professional foreign armies or vice versa, we can engage in mutually beneficial relations with foreigners on a military level."
 swi_defensive_fighting: "Discipline in Defensive Fights"
 swi_defensive_fighting_desc: "Defensive warfare is not the ideal type of warfare for many states since it implies they are on the losing end usually, but Swiss people have been teaching other German people groups that defensive fighting is exactly what can chip away at enemy morale and manpower reserves. Bolstering our fortifications and having concrete exit retreat areas and strategies is what can help German people sustain fewer casualties whilst also keeping the enemy at bay."
 swi_swiss_lessons_on_unity: "To Unite is to Learn"
 swi_swiss_lessons_on_unity_desc: "The chronicles of the past for various German people groups are vast, but for the Swiss it is certiainly more focused on attempts at unification alongside what tests the will of people who dare to try and unite the various petty states into one mass. Others in Germany could stand to learn about this in earnest and helping teach the benefits of unification will bolster their confidence in our state over the coming decades. Swiss stories do seem to be timeless tales, do they not?"

 #Mughal Ideas#
 mansabdars_and_sowars: "Mansabdars and Sowars"
 mansabdars_and_sowars_desc: "Within our administrative structure, we need to form new positions of importance in the ranks of our military. The notion of mansabdars has been floated around by many in our administration, but it is only recently that many are waking up to the fact that such a system would do us very well. These mansabdars, who are traditionally in charge of military matters, high civil offices, and provincial governance, will serve the Mughal Empire well into the future and the system of ranks including that of the 'zat' and 'sowar' can be adjusted as time goes on."
 no_tribute_but_instead_new_agriculture: "A Closer Look at Agriculture"
 no_tribute_but_instead_new_agriculture_desc: "When we came upon the subcontinent, we found a distinctly old fashioned system of agriculture in place throughout the various areas past the Khyber Pass. We will be the bringers of a new age of agriculture to this subcontinent and do away with these ineffective old methods of collecting taxes and tribute through agriculture. It will take many months of hard work but instituting these agrarian reforms and placing an emphasis on meritocratic civil administration will help bolster production output and make it easier to develop rural lands all across our empire."
 the_ibadat_khana: "A True House of Worship"
 the_ibadat_khana_desc: "For a great many centuries, Muslims have ruled lands in Hindustan as minorities amongst Hindu populations. The various Muslim leaders and officials were right to not force conversions upon the Hindus, Jains, and Buddhists they came across, but they did nothing more beyond simply tolerating those outside of Islam in this diverse land. We will build upon this foundation of tolerance and build what is the first in the long line of such functional structures: a House of Worship, or, an Ibadat Khana. No matter their faith, let Muslims converse with Hindus, let Buddhists converse with Christians; all can be welcome into these theological and philosophical places of discussion."
 architecture_fit_for_our_empire: "The Pinnacle of Architecture"
 architecture_fit_for_our_empire_desc: "Coming across these vast lands of Hindustan with so many cultures and traditions that can be traced back thousands of years, it would certainly seem that we have our work cut out for us in terms of making an impact through new buildings like mosques, temples, forts, and palaces. Yet, we are ambitious enough to pursue these architectural goals as we have an influx of Persian influences from the west that are actively being combined with native Hindustani styles. This Indo-Islamic architecture that we are cultivating will be what future generations look upon in awe, and they will enhance our prestige to any foreigner that travels to our land."
 zamindars_and_marzabans: "Zamindars and Marzabans"
 zamindars_and_marzabans_desc: "Local rulers who are more used to Hindu, Jain, and Buddhist populations than we are lay scattered around our empire, paying lip service to our administration whilst skirting around some regulations we have in place. This cannot stand if we are to continue to expand both internally and externally, which is exactly where the system of zamindars and marzabans comes into play. These zamindars and marzabans will be formalized as time goes on and will be given land grants and the right to collect taxes from their own local populations, but they will also be required to hold down the land with forces from the very population they rule over in accordance with mansabdari forces."
 transition_out_of_wars_for_the_throne: "Peace of the Mughal Throne"
 transition_out_of_wars_for_the_throne_desc: "For far too long we have suffered under the weight of pretenders rising up and trying to take the throne when the old ruler is close to death. Sons and cousins waging civil war to take the throne for themselves only causes needless suffering and stresses the administration of the Mughal Empire even further than what it already goes through. Thus, it is clear that we must reform the system of succession to our throne and give the sons, daughters, and even nieces and nephews of the current ruler a proper job throughout the administration or military."
 proto_industrialization_of_the_subcontinent: "Proto-Industrialization!"
 proto_industrialization_of_the_subcontinent_desc: "The years go by in our empire and throughout its growth, we are seeing villages turn into towns and towns growing into cities. Urban populations are growing like never before, new production techniques are being utilized by textile weavers, and industries such as shipbuilding and metalware and agriculture are growing at unprecedented paces. Whilst our administration might struggle to keep up with how high our internally development is growing, we will be sure to profit greatly from this rising tide of industrial output. We will have little need of outside imports if we can truly harness the power we have here in Hindustan."

 #Russian Ideas#
 independence_from_the_patriarch_down_south: "An Independent Russian Church"
 independence_from_the_patriarch_down_south_desc: "For decades now, our status as dependent on the Eastern Orthodox Church in the south at Constantinople has been loosening. The rising power of the Russian people is something that should push this forward so that we can secure ourselves as independent in all church functions, legitimizing our administration in more ways than one over time. Our reliance on outsiders is no more; Russia's rise is now at hand."
 the_siberian_frontier: "The Siberian Frontier Awaits!"
 the_siberian_frontier_desc: "Whilst we struggle with our efforts against the Polish, Lithuanians, Swedish, and Turkish enemies in our west, the east is rather empty beyond the likes of steppe nomads that seem to be on the brink of collapse half of the time. These vast lands of Siberia would be far more useful if we were to annex them into Russia, slowly developing them over time and extracting what resources they have so that the more prosperous parts of Russia (like Moscow, Novgorod, and Tver) can grow even more."
 taming_of_the_steppe: "Taming of the Steppe"
 taming_of_the_steppe_desc: "Whether it is the steppe near the mouth of the Dnieper River or the steppe that is east of it, we have been plagued by steppe nomads for ages now. Russian cities like Ryazan, Moscow, and Tver have seen countless raids by these fiends in the past and the old power structures were not able to withstand the onslaught of these ruthless marauders, but Russia... Russia is far different from those old states... We will utilize gunpowder weapons in whatever form they may take and we will, through sheer brute force or through skilled seizure of towns and villages, tame these unruly steppe hordes. There will be an end to their terror, and it will be the Russian flag that stands atop their burned out settlements."
 move_the_earth_with_cannons: "Moving the Earth with Cannons"
 move_the_earth_with_cannons_desc: "What we have learned from our experience with dealing with steppe nomads and also with our foes in the west is the fact that, cannons are the way of the future. They move the earth like no other siege engine before and are far better at breaking into fortifications than ladders, trebuchets, or tunnel digging. Russia's artillery henceforth become one of the strongest in all of Europe, just so long as we can afford to keep them in production and updated as new and better versions are invented by our engineers."
 serve_for_life_serve_to_die: "Serve for Life; Serve to Die"
 serve_for_life_serve_to_die_desc: "Russia is a vast empire, is it not? Our lands stretch from horizon to horizon in many places, which means we are going to need a hefty amount of soldiers to ensure that the land is secure when at peace, and also to expand said land when at war. Our solution to this issue is that of cheap soldiers that can be recruited for life; they need not be armed to the point of some other armies in Western Europe, they only need just enough equipment to fight and just enough money to keep them alive, nothing more. They will be cheap, large in number, and willing to fight and die for the motherland."
 do_away_with_the_old_boyars: "Old Boyars No More"
 do_away_with_the_old_boyars_desc: "We cannot cling to old social and societal traditions if we are to keep going as a strong and robust empire. Boyars of old noble families are righteous in some senses, but the issue at hand is their noble blood getting them high positions in society when someone more educated and more qualified is available. We need to actively work to break down these old traditions and instill a much more merit-based system of administration so that Russia as a whole can benefit from educated advisors, ministers, and governors."
 serfs_for_life_serfs_without_mobility: "Serfs for Life; Serfs in Place"
 serfs_for_life_serfs_without_mobility_desc: "Though we do appreciate the changes we have put in place for the higher classes of Russian society, the lower classes are not deserving of as much attention. They need to be working the land and being ready to serve Russia when they are called upon; serfdom is simply going to be the law of the land in the majority of our empire. It may be unappealing to outsiders, but we have no need of these peasants gaining social mobility, no, we need them to keep to their own social class with no objections."

 #Rostov Ideas#
 memories_of_sarkoya_gorodishche: "Memories of Sarkoya Gorodishche"
 memories_of_sarkoya_gorodishche_desc: "It is an old memory, but one that should not be forgotten in Rostov. Before the rise of our city, there was the fortified village of sorts named 'Sarkoya Gorodishche'. There are plenty of mysteries surrounding it but it remains one of the foundational pieces of history for our people and our capital city. Its purpose as a fortified village should be remembered and kept close so that, in the future when we expand Rostov itself, the city expands its own fortifications too."
 memories_of_rostov_suzdal: "Rostov-Suzdal and Vladimir-Suzdal"
 memories_of_rostov_suzdal_desc: "The power of Rostov crystallized some centuries ago as Suzdal and Vladimir rose to power with the fall of the Kievan Rus in the west. At first, Rostov-Suzdal took power as things tumbled down, and then Vladimir took Rostov's place and the state became known as Vladimir-Suzdal. And yet, Rostov stood by throughout that time as a strong economic city near the other two, thriving and prospering. We could actually use these old claims from Vladimir-Suzdal to enforce our own expansions throughout these lands, being a worthy successor to the old grand duchy."
 a_pillar_of_eastern_orthodoxy: "A Pillar of Russian Orthodoxy"
 a_pillar_of_eastern_orthodoxy_desc: "What helped Rostov transform from a small village of sorts into a bustling city of trade and wealth (before the Mongols came through) was the fact that Rostov was a center of Eastern Orthodoxy. From our city many places were converted around us and powerful bishops and archbishops came to be seated either in or very close to Rostov itself. Let us carry forth this religious legacy into the future no matter what happens to our internal politics."
 elevation_from_archbishops_to_metropolitans: "From Archbishops to Metropolitans"
 elevation_from_archbishops_to_metropolitans_desc: "The ambition of our religious figures are not political in nature, but rather they are clerical in nature. They seek to be the center of Russian Orthodoxy and to have the seat of our faith be in Rostov and Rostov alone. To have a Rostov Metropolitan Bishop is going to be tough as the metropolitan currently has his chair with Moscow, but with enough coercion, internal growth, and decisive political moves, we can get a future metropolitan move the chair to Rostov."
 build_a_kremlin_for_rostov: "A Kremlin for Rostov"
 build_a_kremlin_for_rostov_desc: "The Mongols left a number of harsh scars and memories with the Russian people, and it is from these scars and memories that they must learn from. Part of this is the fact that having a fortified city center is a must, especially for capitals like Rostov. If we can work to build up a proper kremlin in the heart of Rostov and ensure it is engineered to withstand any attack whilst also displaying our prosperity, we will earn more trust from our own people and cultivate a stronger capital city."
 revitalize_enamel_production: "Enamels of Rostov"
 revitalize_enamel_production_desc: "Vitreous, or, porcelain enamel is something Rostov has been manufacturing for many generations now. By fusing powdered glass to a basis of some kind through fiery temperatures, we create beautiful pieces of glass, metal, ceramics, or stone that many value to a high degree. Continuing this traditional work in Rostov and perhaps even building places specifically to house enamel artists could bolster Rostov's reputation and trade power abroad."
 rostov_veliky: "Rostov Veliky"
 rostov_veliky_desc: "Is it enough that Rostov is rebounding from the days of the Mongol Yoke? No, economic growth and political stability are rewards in their own right but they alone are not fit for Rostov and its great past. We of Rostov must look toward battling the other states of the Rus for hegemony over the land and uniting these separate cities such as Novgorod, Moscow, Tver, and Pskov. By the end of it all, the name that will be on the lips of our people and those near and far will be 'Rostov Veliky', Great Rostov"

 #Tverian Ideas#
 old_rivals_in_northwest_russia: "Old Rivals; Old Feuds"
 old_rivals_in_northwest_russia_desc: "From our very inception, Tver has needed its sword drawn and shield at the ready for whatever happened around it. Moscow, Suzdal, Novgorod, and so many others too, they were all and still are potential enemies of Tver. It is because of this tense and hostile history that we must reinforce our claims through war, not diplomacy."
 extreme_anti_tatar_sentiment: "Extreme Anti-Tatar Sentiment"
 extreme_anti_tatar_sentiment_desc: "From the Tver Uprising in 1327 to other smaller revolts, Tver has always been a haven for people who refused to obey the Mongol Yoke. It is, however, with great sadness that we remember how brutally our efforts were suppressed; so many civilians and righteous fighters killed as reprisals, and many in the royal family descended of Yaroslav III were executed. With these scars on our heart and our people ready for whatever could come next, Tver will fight for every last bit of land that it can."
 refuse_the_power_of_moscow: "The Russian Chess Board"
 refuse_the_power_of_moscow_desc: "The pieces that move around on the chess board that is the states of the Rus are trying to get whatever power they can in the shortest amount of time. Many see the rise of Moscow on this board as inevitable, but we of Tver refuse this notion altogether. We are ready to hold out in our small corner of the board, complete with fortifications and loyal soldiers at the ready. If we have to draw this chess game out for years and decades to defeat Moscow, we will do exactly that."
 rein_in_kashin_kholm_zubtsov: "Unification of Tver"
 rein_in_kashin_kholm_zubtsov_desc: "As the 1300s went on and Moscow continued to gain influence, they chipped away at the authority of Tver and made some of its neighboring lands semi-independent (Kashin, Kholm, and Zubtsov). This greatly reduced the power of Tver as a whole and made it into a mere pawn on the Russian chess board, instead of perhaps a bishop or a knight. Now is the time that we must rein in these autonomous lands that Moscow has sought from us; unification is not going to be an option for them, not after they helped bring about our decline in the past."
 exiled_princes_no_more: "No Longer in Exile"
 exiled_princes_no_more_desc: "Tver's time in exile because of the events of the past has been formative to say the least. We have learned much in the way of city building, succession laws, military organizing, and even diplomatic endeavors, all of this culminating in a more reformed and established Tver that cannot be pushed around like before. Learning from the past is not easy, but Tver has been forced to do just that."
 friends_in_hostile_places: "Look to Outside Help"
 friends_in_hostile_places_desc: "In the past, we have looked to outside states for help against the rising threat of Moscow. During the reign of Mikhail II, he strived to ally the Grand Duchy of Lithuania against Moscow and the Golden Horde, but unfortunately this led to the other princes around Tver invading and dismantling even more of Tver's base of power. Thus, it is these harsh lessons in outside diplomacy that we must learn from so that in the future, we are not hampered by unfortunate diplomatic circumstances."
 tempered_and_scarred_past: "The Rise of Tver"
 tempered_and_scarred_past_desc: "The scars of our past, the tempering of our ambition, all of it goes into the military force of Tver. We have not been able to rely on money and diplomacy like Novgorod, nor have we been able to rely on a stalwart administration to keep us afloat. What matters at the end of it all is military might and Tver has learned this after its failures in the past against not only Moscow, but against the Mongols as well. The rise of Tver is now at hand."

 #Yaroslavl Ideas#
 remembering_the_battle_of_the_sit_river: "The Battle of the Sit River"
 remembering_the_battle_of_the_sit_river_desc: "It was the fateful Battle of the Sit River in March of 1238 that decided the fate of many Russian people, including those of Yaroslavl. The death of Yuri II of Vladimir-Suzdal and the death of Vsevolod Konstantinovich of Yaroslavl meant that the Mongols were able to sack a great many cities, including our very own city that sits on the banks of the Volga River. Let us never forget this tragic battle and what blood we shed during it, for the blood shed back then has only strengthened our resolve for the future in the hopes of keeping Yaroslavl safe forever more."
 amidst_rus_dynastic_movements: "Dynastic Movements in the Rus"
 amidst_rus_dynastic_movements_desc: "There are several shifts in the dynastic matters of the Rus principalities. Whether it is a bride from Rostov marrying into Moscow or someone from Tver marrying into our own lineage and so on and so forth, we of Yaroslavl would be wise to keep track of these changes in who is married to who and which leader is allied to which state."
 revenge_against_moscow: "Revenge Against Moscow"
 revenge_against_moscow_desc: "We have not forgotten what Ivan I of Moscow did to our dear city back in the early 1300s. 1332 was that fateful year when he burned down part of our city under the order of the Mongol Khan at the time, thus weakening Yaroslavl in general. When we are able to, we will do just the same to Moscow and exact revenge on the princes of Moscow so that they may feel how we felt during that time of blazing destruction."
 from_wood_to_stone_buildings: "Lessons from Wooden Buildings"
 from_wood_to_stone_buildings_desc: "We would be mistaken if we thought that Yaroslavl's burning on multiple occasions was the fault of foreigners alone; part of it is because of our own design philosophy. We have made buildings out of wood for so long now that stone buildings seem almost strange to many of Yaroslavl, but we cannot deny the fact that if Yaroslavl is to grow and prosper, the wooden buildings need to be replaced with something less prone to fire. Thus, the easiest solution? Stone buildings."
 independent_identity_from_moscow: "Independent Yaroslavl Identity"
 independent_identity_from_moscow_desc: "Moscow's center of trade and culture pulls in many great minds, that is true, but Yaroslavl has its own perks and potential that can be realized over time if given the resources to do so. Managing as are, if we can keep our independent city away from Muscovite influences and cultivate a stronger Yaroslavl for both civilian and administrative purposes, we will surely be the envy of all other cities in the Rus in due time."
 appanages_of_yaroslavl_reined_in: "Enforce the Will of Yaroslavl"
 appanages_of_yaroslavl_reined_in_desc: "It is not by choice that pieces of Yaroslavl were taken away previously in order to be made into semi-independent principalities. Now that Yaroslavl is looking up in the world, we will look toward introducing these lands back into fold of Yaroslavl through more peaceful and diplomatic approaches; we would rather not expend more military resources than what is necessary if diplomacy works just as well."
 connecting_yaroslavls_pieces: "Stone Buildings, Stone Roads"
 connecting_yaroslavls_pieces_desc: "With the transition to stone buildings set in motion for Yaroslavl and its surrounding villages and towns, the work toward building a proper road network throughout our land is well under way. Stone roads instead of rough dirt paths will facilitate easier movement for anyone and everyone, meaning faster communication between communities and an even stronger administration stemming from Yaroslavl."

 #Perm, but really Komi, Ideas#
 weakened_novgorod_authority: "More Autonomy for the Komi People"
 weakened_novgorod_authority_desc: "As the authority of Novgorod weakened over the 1300s and 1400s, we, the Komi people, have come into our own. Our state is more autonomous than before and we are governing politics in a manner in which Novgorod would never have let happen previously. Now we must still fear the wrath of Muscovite princes here and there, but for now, the Komi people can look forward to a more prosperous future where they can handle their own military and political matters at a certain scale."
 ready_to_play_off_three_powers: "Ready Player 4"
 ready_to_play_off_three_powers_desc: "The three powers that have come to define the 1400s near us are Kazan, Muscovy, and Novgorod. Though we are on the outer perimeter of politics for these three powerful states, the Komi people are not without vision on what political shifts happen to their west and south. If we are to expand our power even slightly, we must be ready to play these three off of each other whenever we can as a subtle yet key 4th Player."
 amidst_forests_of_the_komi: "Amidst the Forests of the Komi"
 amidst_forests_of_the_komi_desc: "Forests and rivers are what dominate the landscape of the Komi. Our state has scattered villages and towns of course, but none can deny that if fights take place in our land, it is among the forests and woods and by the rivers and creeks. If commanders and soldiers don't know how to navigate these lands, they will die by those that do, and just who exactly are the masters of this kind of warfare? The Komi people of course."
 cultivate_river_trade_chances: "River Trade Chances"
 cultivate_river_trade_chances_desc: "We thrive off trade through the rivers that flow in our land; it is one of the key reasons why Novgorod kept us around as a tributary state of sorts in previous centuries. Thanks to their decline in influence and the steady rise of Komi power though, river trading has become more common and the profits are flowing into our pockets most if not all the time. Establishing more secure river crossings and outposts alongside the rivers will only increase how far we can send our merchants and how much they can bring back with them."
 offensive_advantages_stop_here: "Permafrost Defense"
 offensive_advantages_stop_here_desc: "Bolstering our defenses is not an easy thing to do since our lands are harder to develop as a whole. What helps us out in this regard is nature itself as the Komi people have come to partly rely on nature providing partial cover from projectiles and obstacles that large hulking armies can't move around easily. Knowing where these key points of defense are and building more defenses around them will be what can boost the Komi defense strategy by leaps and bounds."
 open_up_fields_for_grazing: "Southern Lands for Grazing"
 open_up_fields_for_grazing_desc: "The lands to the south of our capital are warmer and have less trees in general, meaning they are fit for a different kind of lifestyle. Grazing herds of horses and cattle are much more suited to these conditions as opposed to up north, which is why we will sponsor segments of our population to settle the southern lands and open up more proper fields for grazing herds of animals. These herds should be able to help supply our military with horses and baggage animals alike."
 land_of_the_endless_towers: "Endless Wood for Endless Defenses"
 land_of_the_endless_towers_desc: "We are already making use of the natural defenses given to us by nature, and we utilize the cold weather as well as our own expertise in forest combat to our advantage, but what else can we do to keep the Komi people safe and to keep our state safe from invasions? Why, we can begin to build outposts and towers to dot the landscape, intricate in their design and sturdy in their construction so that they cannot be toppled or broken down without a great amount of force. With the amount of timber ready to use too, these fortified outposts and towers will be the bane of any enemies that dare set foot in our land."

 #Beloozero Ideas#
 once_ruled_partly_by_khans: "How Beloozero Began"
 once_ruled_partly_by_khans_desc: "Beloozero was rife with growth in the times before 1400. What began as a principality detached from Rostov around 1238 grew into a prosperous place ruled by Prince Gleb who married Sartaq Khan's daughter. In this sense, Beloozero was partly ruled by khans of the past and can easily call upon this partial heritage to drum up support for conquests around the Rus. It won't be easy considering how strong Moscow and Novgorod remain as of the 1400s, but Beloozero has seen more drastic shifts in power before."
 the_rural_north_of_the_rus: "The Rural North"
 the_rural_north_of_the_rus_desc: "Where we are situated, there are far fewer towns and villages than there are when compared to southern places like Smolensk, Moscow, and Chernigov. This isolation is ideal for a defense-oriented warfare which Beloozero's military is already trained in. If our enemies cannot reach the heart of Beloozero without losing a few hundreds or thousands of troops to the cold and forested terrain, we will have far greater chances of eliminating them altogether."
 what_moscow_gives_we_accept: "Benefits from Moscow"
 what_moscow_gives_we_accept_desc: "The Kirillo-Belozersky Monastery and the Ferapontov Monastery were built in 1397 and 1398 respectively, and both are key points of interest to the pious Eastern Orthodox folks who travel to Beloozero. Maintaining these monasteries that were granted to us by descendants of Dmitry Donskoy of Moscow will keep the name 'Beloozero' in the minds of many, in a positive way of course. If Moscow were to give us even more funding for additional prestigious structures, we would only be happy to accept such offers."
 a_hand_in_northern_trade: "A Hand in Northern Trade"
 a_hand_in_northern_trade_desc: "The rural northern lands of the Rus are not completely desolate or isolated; Novgorod has shown us and many others that there are trade routes that run through these lands so that fur can be transported to more western and southern markets. If Beloozero can perhaps build more markets and designate more clearings for traders to pass through, its trade power in the north will rise as time goes on and perhaps even replace Novgorod's trade power."
 raise_up_beloozeros_family: "Northern Royalty"
 raise_up_beloozeros_family_desc: "Though some would look upon our royal family with a shrug or a roll of the eyes, they aren't as weak as some would predict. The monasteries and markets that they hold sway over have given Beloozero a higher sense of worth and influence all around the northern parts of the Rus, meaning that more and more high minded people are making their way toward our capital city. Let us make room for these intellectuals in our own court, for their skills are exactly what can give Beloozero the edge it needs in the politics of the Rus."
 the_borael_forests_shield_us: "The Great Boreal Forests"
 the_borael_forests_shield_us_desc: "Much like in the eastern principality of the Komi people, Beloozero is rife with forests that are just waiting to be used for defensive purposes. Though we should avoid building all our structures out of wood for fear of fires being able to spread easily, constructing scattered yet connected defenses in the form of outposts and towers would help keep Beloozero's core safe from harm."
 organizing_all_of_the_northern_trade: "Seize All Northern Trade Routes"
 organizing_all_of_the_northern_trade_desc: "With unprecedented growth happening all throughout Beloozero, it is only right that we seize all of the trade routes in the north so that we may control all the income that stems from such trade routes. And if southern powers or towns think they can strike at Beloozero's economy in some way (like through embargoes), we can easily cut them off from the vital northern trade routes that supply us. A great deal of the Rus depends on the profits of the fur trade, and us having a powerful grip over it means we will have a powerful grip over other states in the Rus."

 #Novgorod Ideas#
 rivals_on_two_sides_of_novgorod: "Threats in Moscow, Vilnius, and Krakow"
 rivals_on_two_sides_of_novgorod_desc: "For many decades Novgorod now we have faced threats coming from our southwest and our southeast. The Poles and Lithuanians seek to take over the Baltic whilst Moscow seeks to end Novgorod altogether, and yet we still stand here, ready to defend our state and our principles and what territory that we have fought for in previous centuries. The time is now for us to expand our military arsenal for the coming years of war since we know very well that our traditional rivals are not going to stop fighting against us until they are firmly dead."
 sustain_novgorods_economic_importance: "Retain Economic Importance"
 sustain_novgorods_economic_importance_desc: "Whilst the people of Novgorod participated in economic matters such as catching fish for food, obtaining salt for a number of matters, and growing crops like flax and hops, what has been the life-blood of Novgorod since its inception has been the fur trade. Even as it declines slowly over time due to new sources of fur opening up to European markets, we can still strive to maintain our economic importance by building up markets and towns so that merchants can make more of a profit off of various resources that come from Novgorod. This should go hand-in-hand with keeping control over the northern trade routes of course."
 memories_of_the_struggles_against_catholics: "The Wall Against Catholics"
 memories_of_the_struggles_against_catholics_desc: "Ever since the Teutonic Knights and the Catholic Scandinavians started to look eastward in the 1200s, Novgorod was the one staunch barrier to spreading Catholicism in what was then fairly fresh Eastern Orthodox grounds. This wall against Catholicism has remained stalwart ever since this time period and was shown off in magnificent fashion in the Battle on the Ice in 1242. Like how Alexander Nevsky led Novgorod's forces on that day, we will do so in the future and preserve Eastern Orthodoxy against all Catholic incursions."
 development_without_the_mongol_scourge: "Artistic Talent of Novgorod"
 development_without_the_mongol_scourge_desc: "Unlike the cities of Suzdal, Rostov, Tver, and Moscow, Novogorod boasts considerable fame for its artwork of various kinds, from that which is done by the hands of a single artisan to that which is done by a team of engineers. Prominent boyar families in our land have and still do commission detailed and elaborate icons and also churches and cathedrals around our land have many detailed icons that show off just how much prowess we have in terms of artistry. So long as our grand state lives on, so too will our artistic endeavors."
 let_all_classes_in_novgorod_read: "Manuscripts and Books for All Citizens"
 let_all_classes_in_novgorod_read_desc: "We do not see our peasants and merchants like how Moscow or Krakow see their own. Novgorod is not keen on keeping knowledge from its peasantry, or, at least not to the level of our neighbors. The manuscripts written by either men or women in our land may be read by peasants, merchants, or boyars, all should be able to as time goes on and as more are produced. Some will find this aspect of Novgorod strange, but, we see it as a righteous endeavor; knowledge shouldn't be limited to just those of prominent status."
 the_importance_of_neva: "Expand our Baltic Sea Influence"
 the_importance_of_neva_desc: "Whilst we have not been the greatest at projecting our influence out at sea due to various matters keeping our attention geared toward the mainland, the time is coming where we can finally pay more attention to the place wher most of our sea trade goes: The Baltic Sea. Denmark, Sweden, and the Hanseatic League will still be thorns in the side of Novgorod's trade sector, but the more time we dedicate to building trade ships and establishing trade relations, the more influence we will obtain over time."
 protests_spur_political_development: "Listen to the Reasons of Peasants"
 protests_spur_political_development_desc: "Numerous times since we have existed as an independent political entity there have been peasant protests and some serious revolts. These revolts weren't like the ones we see in the monarchies of Europe though, as they were more aimed wanting better ruling from the upper classes. Thus, when we encounter future protests and riots, we shouldn't meet these people with executions at every turn, we should instead look to what they have to say and learn to compromise at points with those who are, for better or for worse, the majority of the population in our state. Novgorod is not one to oppress its population, not like the princes of Moscow."

 #Odoyev Ideas#
 bordering_the_steppe_to_our_south: "Precarious Circumstances..."
 bordering_the_steppe_to_our_south_desc: "Since our inception, Odoyev has been subjected to various raids, skirmishes, and conquests from both the steppe and from the settled people of the Rus. We have not sought to cut down our enemies because we know we are not powerful enough (for now, that is), but we will seek out is good trade deals with both our steppe neighbors and our Rus relatives. Guarding these trade routes along the Oka River also gives us a great deal of practice in manning the walls and fortifications we have already built."
 caught_between_lithuania_and_moscow: "... Necessitates Several Compromises"
 caught_between_lithuania_and_moscow_desc: "In the early 1400s, our small duchy was the subject of debate and conquest by Lithuania whilst Muscovy's power in the east was on the rise. Though we were snatched by Lithuania firstly in those early decades of the 1400s, Muscovy struck back later on and thus the influence of both powerful states clashed in and around Odoyev itself. If we are to save our lowly capital from destruction akin to what happened in May of 1407, then we must be ready to negotiate at all times with Muscovite princes and Lithuanian grand dukes."
 lending_and_receiving_troops: "Border Region for Two Giants"
 lending_and_receiving_troops_desc: "Being that Odoyev is a sort of border region for Lithuanians and Muscovites, it is fitting that we see a fair deal of troop movements across our territory. These troops of course are not always ours as some are clearly mercenary bands hired by either power for their own purposes, but that does not stop Odoyev from perhaps offering these mercenary bands a better deal. They're roaming our land from time to time anyways, why not buy them out and perhaps ensure our own safety?"
 tribute_in_exchange_for_land_was_our_status: "What Belongs to Odoyev Princes"
 tribute_in_exchange_for_land_was_our_status_desc: "In the treaty of 1427 between the House of Novosil and Odoyev with the Grand Duke of Lithuania at the time, Vytautas the Great, our leaders would be the subject of the Lithuania and given land within Lithuania itself, so long yearly tribute was paid. This treaty is long since gone due to new leaders and new officials coming to power, but we can still easily press claims we have on Lithuanian land and maybe even land we lost in the east. Tribute for land can be a dangerous deal sometimes, it's just hard to see how bad it could be in the future."
 transition_from_novosil_to_odoyev: "No Longer of Novosil"
 transition_from_novosil_to_odoyev_desc: "Whilst in the past we styled ourselves as 'Dukes of Novosil', this has become relatively outdated as we have come to center ourselves not at Novosil, but instead at Odoyev. Fully moving our seat of power to Odoyev in every sense would instill a greater amount of trust in our people and, as Odoyev continues to develop, bring forth more prosperity to our own royal house."
 defenses_of_the_oka_river: "Oka River Defenses"
 defenses_of_the_oka_river_desc: "The very river on which we derive our life and prosperity is that of the Oka River, this is no secret to anyone. Defending it with whatever we can though is something that is becoming increasingly clear to our own population, this motivation of which we are only too happy to indulge. Whether it is stronger and more deeply laid garrisons or thicker walls for our fortifications, we of Odoyev will be the righteous defender of the Oka River no matter what."
 southern_stronghold_rising: "From Lowly Outpost to Stalwart Bastion"
 southern_stronghold_rising_desc: "For many decades now, Odoyev has been looked at as a mere border region, a land that was merely in reserve for any large power capable of holding it down for an extended period of time. But is that time of conquest truly coming? We simply won't wait to find out as there are too many things to get done in Odoyev! We are a rising bastion of defended trade routes and prosperous state mixed with Russian, Lithuanian, and Tatar people. We will do everything in our power to ensure that Odoyev continues to be a southern bastion of greatness no matter what is imposed on us from any direction."

 #Chernhiv Ideas#
 what_once_was_chernigov: "What was the 'City of Legends'"
 what_once_was_chernigov_desc: "It was during the 1000s to early 1200s that the Grand Principality of Chernigov was at its peak. Striving for power against Kiev in many instances whilst also holding its own power and even helping Kiev at times when it suited Chernigov as a whole, our history is rich with stories of conflict, affection, and prestige. Upholding this heritage of ours and building up Chernigov into a strong power in the region once more will earn us the respect and loyalty of the citizens we rule over."
 kievan_dependence_on_chernigov: "Second Only to Kiev"
 kievan_dependence_on_chernigov_desc: "While Yaroslav the Wise ruled over Kiev and Novgorod from 1019 to 1054, Mstislav ruled over Chernigov from 1024 to 1036 and helped cultivate it into an important center of trade, administration, and Eastern Orthodoxy through religious patronage. Though after Mstislav's death Chernigov was integrated back into Kiev for the duration of Yaroslav's reign, the mark Mstislav made was never undone as Chernigov remained a viable competitor to Kiev's administrative power. In time we will make this known once more and re-establish order throughout the old lands of Chernigov as well as all of the Rus."
 developments_of_chernihiv_cities: "Confluence of Many Developments"
 developments_of_chernihiv_cities_desc: "Our capital city was decimated by the forces of Batu Khan in 1239; this drastic event started a long period of hardship for all who called Chernigov home. Still though, there is life in this old city and in the royalty as well as courtiers who still reside in Chernigov and its nearby villages. Promoting developments in agriculture, infrastructure, and even simple road building will go a long way in restoring Chernigov's internal power and authority whilst also ensuring that its economic prospects rebound upward from those lowly times of the 1200s and 1300s."
 compound_on_our_religious_importance: "Religious Heart in the South"
 compound_on_our_religious_importance_desc: "One of the most outstanding places in all of Chernigov is the Transfiguration Cathedral, commissioned by Mstislav and then finished by Yaroslav the Wise in the mid-1000s. Renovating the cathedral itself, promoting more religious development through the construction of monasteries, and establishing firm authority for our Orthodox leadership will help cement Chernigov as a bastion of Eastern Orthodoxy in the south of the Rus."
 militarized_frontier_area: "Frontiers of Chernigov"
 militarized_frontier_area_desc: "Few would say that Chernigov is a truly peaceful place; time and time again its lands are crossed by roving bands of cossacks and mercenaries alike. In a sense, these militarized groups have forced our hand in militarizing Chernigov as a whole, even more so than when we faced threats from the Cumans and Kievan civil wars. Formalized training measures, loyal and brave commanders, and a robust system of command that is developed properly over time will give Chernigov the edge it needs to sustain itself, regardless of the threats that come forth."
 adaptation_to_steppe_warfare: "Learning from Steppe Hordes"
 adaptation_to_steppe_warfare_desc: "If it was not for the steppe hordes to our south and southeast, where would Chernigov be? Perhaps much better off or perhaps integrated fully into the Kievan Rus, but that would take away the valuable lessons we have learned over the generations in regards to how they fight. Unlike the traditional shield walls and heavy infantry/cavalry charges our northern neighbors were used to, we have grown up around both those tactics and steppe horde tactics being used on us extensively. Utilizing these tactics in the form of an organized light cavalry arm that can skirmish effectively will put Chernigov well ahead of other states in the Rus."
 an_understanding_with_jews: "Recognize Religious Minorities"
 an_understanding_with_jews_desc: "We are not exactly fond of Muslim minorities or Jewish minorities in the lands of Chernigov as our ecclesiastic authority dictates that we should be bringing their souls to God through conversions, but we cannot hide from the fact that these communities of religious minorities in Chernigov contribute a fair amount to our economy as it is. Angering them through forced conversion would simply cause undue tension and unrest and slow down our economy, so in the interest of our state as a whole instead of just the clergy themselves, we will take steps to formally recognize these minorities and protect them."

 #Polotsk Ideas#
 the_great_vseslav_of_polotsk: "Vseslav of Polotsk's Legacy"
 the_great_vseslav_of_polotsk_desc: "The reign of Vseslav of Polotsk is legendary to many for good reasons. Excluded from grand princely succession due to how the lineage lined up in dynastic matters during the days of the Kievan Rus, he took matters into his own hands and pillaged parts of the Kievan Rus, laid siege to Pskov without success, pillaged and burnt Novgorod for the benefit of his cathedral in Polotsk, and he even came close to cutting off the sons of Yaroslav from valuable northern trade. During the Kiev Uprising of 1068, the crowds freed Vseslav from his captivity (since he lost the Battle of the Nemiga River in 1067) and placed him on the throne, though only for a single year. Still, he made Polotsk into a serious force to be reckoned with and we will follow in his very footsteps!"
 from_scandinavia_to_russian_lands: "The Flow of Trade Kept Safe"
 from_scandinavia_to_russian_lands_desc: "From Scandinavia and from the Rus, trade flows back and forth across the lands of Polotsk and its surroundings. Keeping to our traditional heritage of securing these valued trade routes so that merchants from all around us are safe is what will garner Polotsk more and more revenue and influence."
 the_heavy_fortifications_of_polotsk: "Embrasures, Towers, Walls!"
 the_heavy_fortifications_of_polotsk_desc: "During our shining period under the rule of Vseslav of Polotsk, our capital was described by Norse sagas at the time as one of the most fortified towns in the entire Kievan Rus. Though this is very much not the case anymore since the Kievan Rus is long dead and Polotsk has witnessed a staggering decline since Vseslav's generation, we can still make an effort to rebound upward and fortify our capital once more. It will take years of manpower and money, but it will be worth it in the end so that we can promote a strong and cultivated capital city."
 lessons_on_dyanstic_bonds: "The Lasting Bonds of Marriage"
 lessons_on_dyanstic_bonds_desc: "Polotsk made several ties to local communities and polities near the Baltic coast, but these dynastic bonds did not stop the incoming tide of crusading knights from the west that plagued our various allies and family members. Still though, this period of mingling with and forming relations with foreign states taught us the value of dynastic bonds. They can be useful far into the future and can help promote influence in lands still controlled by hostile forces, such as the Teutons in our case."
 the_cooler_cathedral_of_holy_wisdom: "The Cathedral of Holy Wisdom, but Better!"
 the_cooler_cathedral_of_holy_wisdom_desc: "The Cathedral of Holy Wisdom in Polotosk was not that noticeable prior to what Vseslav did during his reign, but afterwards, it was something to marvel at. In his raiding and pillaging of Novgorod, he looted Novgorod's own Cathedral of Holy Wisdom and took its bell as well as other decorations back to Polotsk. Even though some from Novgorod petition us to give back these holy relics and prestigious decorations, we have no need to do so; they make our grand cathedral even more beautiful and allow for more relations to be fostered with Christian states that aren't inside the Rus."
 beat_back_teutonic_incursions: "Teutonic Incursions Turned Back"
 beat_back_teutonic_incursions_desc: "Ever since the Teutonic knights invaded the Baltic lands and forced their ways upon the people there, it has become a haven for Catholic, anti-Rus sentiment that must be put down sooner rather than later. We are lucky that both the Teutonic range of influence is shrinking more and more thanks to the work of the Polish, Lithuanians, and even some Teutonic administrators themselves. Soon enough it will be Polotsk's turn to stick a blade into the bleeding knight trying to hold on to what influence it has; it is only a matter of time."
 crossroads_of_eastern_europe: "The People of Polotsk"
 crossroads_of_eastern_europe_desc: "We have in our land a great many people from various cultural backgrounds: some are from Denmark and Sweden, others are Lithuanian or Polish in descent, and yet still others are Livonian or Estonian. All of these languages and cultures flowing into Polotsk's borders means that there will be a great deal of cross-cultural dialogue and tension, but we can start to mitigate the latter by recognizing and extending rights to those who do not speak our own language or practice our own traditions."

 #Smolensk Ideas#
 a_veche_worth_listening_to: "A Veche Worth Listening To"
 a_veche_worth_listening_to_desc: "The popular assembly (also called the 'veche') in Smolensk is by no means as powerful as it is in places like Novgorod or Pskov, but it still has a decent amount of influence throughout Smolensk as a whole. We cannot disregard everything it brings up as that would grind politics to a halt and leave Smolensk decaying internally. Instead, we will seek out compromises with our veche when and where possible whilst aiming to have the highest authority figure have the final say."
 spared_from_fire_but_not_from_servitude: "Costly Survival"
 spared_from_fire_but_not_from_servitude_desc: "Whilst we were not burned to the ground during the invasion of the Mongols from the east, we were subjugated by the Lithuanians to our west and made to pay tribute on multiple occasions. This time of being forced to work the land for a different nation wasn't all bad though as it helped us develop a stronger and more robust infrastructure as well as a greater understanding of how to plan out our capital's expansion. With this knowledge in mind and more innovations coming our way, Smolensk will be set for a bright future in terms of economic development."
 hardened_by_vyutautas_invasions: "Vyutautas's Lessons"
 hardened_by_vyutautas_invasions_desc: "The grand duke of Lithuania in the late 1300s and early 1400s, Vyutautas the Great, he was the one who captured Smolensk on three occasions: 1395, 1404, and finally in 1408. We were integrated into Lithuania after this point on, but now that we are free from that old integrated past, we can utilize the lessons that Vyutautas imparted onto Smolensk's military. A stronger and more capable military with confidence in itself and enough dedication for Smolensk itself will serve to cement our military's potential for the future."
 knowledge_of_lithuanian_governance: "Influences from Lithuania"
 knowledge_of_lithuanian_governance_desc: "Not only is our military influenced by Lithuania's own, but our government itself is too. From the way we organize our provinces and towns to the way we handle things like taxes, trade income, deficits in spending, and collecting tribute, it all has influences from the old grand duchy itself. We may not care much for Lithuania as of today, but we cannot deny the foundation they gave Smolensk as a whole."
 central_kremlin_of_smolensk: "The First Step of a Strong Capital"
 central_kremlin_of_smolensk_desc: "Yet, even as we have been influenced by Lithuania, we have our own traditions imparted to us by the Kievan Rus and the states of the Rus to the east. Perhaps the most shining example of these traditions will be the kremlin in the heart of Smolensk itself, fit for a proper monarch who rules the splendid and prosperous land that is what we hold. It will be a functional and detailed kremlin of course, not just a simple palace or fort with nothing more to it."
 revamped_heavy_fortifications: "Insurance Against Future Invasions"
 revamped_heavy_fortifications_desc: "Much like how Smolensk was during the days of the Kievan Rus, we will begin to emulate the central strength of Smolensk outward through heavy fortifications that utilize not only muskets thick walls, but also defensive artillery too. Cannons that are able to be mounted on certain wall pieces for fortifications would do greatly in terms of helping protect against future sieges."
 wall_between_the_plc_and_the_rus: "The Value in Smolensk"
 wall_between_the_plc_and_the_rus_desc: "For ages now Smolensk has been valued as a trade hub, an administrative center, a haven for Christians going west or east, and also a vital point to capture when wars break out throughout Eastern Europe. As we cultivate our land further and further, this value in Smolensk is only going to grow further which is why we will capitalize on said increasing value by seeking out better diplomatic deals with whatever neighbors are near us. Survival is not only done by fighting, it is also done by diplomatic means."

 #Nizhny Novgorod Ideas#
 in_the_model_of_novgorod: "Looking up to Novgorod"
 in_the_model_of_novgorod_desc: "In the north, Novgorod stands as a bastion of art and glory that we aspire to be like. Whilst their Veche is far too powerful for our liking, the citizens of Nizhny Novgorod are slowly coming to realize just how valuable the position of the city is. Soon enough, the trade routes that flow into and out of Nizhny Novgorod will be flourishing! It just takes careful cultivation and a delicate grasp on politics, both of which we reach for time and time again."
 kurmysh_fortress_and_others: "Kurmysh Fortress"
 kurmysh_fortress_and_others_desc: "Founded in 1372 and perhaps unremarkable to those outside Nizhny Novgorod, our people realize it for what it is: a defensive landmark that proves we can survive and thrive out here in the border region of the Rus and the steppe. In time, we can work toward expanding it through new towers, walls, and even transitioning it from being partly made of wood to being entirely made of stone. If we give it a few generations of work, Kurmysh Fortress will be a Russian symbol of might in the border region."
 learn_from_edigus_destruction: "Edigu's Destruction"
 learn_from_edigus_destruction_desc: "Even though we tell ourselves that we are mighty and strong, able to withstand many blows before giving in, the past tells a different story. 1408 saw the White Horde's leader named Edigu leave a trail of misery and destruction through Nizhny Novgorod, setting its people back decades in terms of prosperity and economic progress. We have come far from this bloody point in our past and we have learned much in the way of organizing our communities so that they are better prepared for invasions and better able to rebuild from disasters that befall them."
 repel_the_tatar_advances: "Build up the Defenses!"
 repel_the_tatar_advances_desc: "And as we continue to shape our communities so that they are fit for this border region between the Rus and the steppe, we will ensure that our walls and garrison spaces are well prepared for whatever cavalry army comes their way. Muskets will be stocked up and ready, gunpowder will be safely stored, and the gates to each fortification will be secured with multiple layers of defense. We simply cannot let our past be written again by yet another steppe horde seeking to reinstate the old yoke upon the Russians."
 regular_movement_of_regiments: "Steppe Lessons on Mobility"
 regular_movement_of_regiments_desc: "There are some aspects of warfare with the steppe hordes that we cannot deny would be good for the military of Nizhny Novgorod. One of these aspects is that of swift movement across the steppe, something they have mastered and we are lagging behind on. If we can incorporate some of the easier to defeat hordes into our domain and utilize their military leadership in our own ranks, we could start to develop a stronger sense of direction and pace for when we move across these vast stretches of land."
 make_the_east_livable_and_likable: "Hard Work Toward Habitability"
 make_the_east_livable_and_likable_desc: "The steppe is by no means an easy place to settle down in. Sure there may be small villages and towns here and there, but mostly it is made of nomadic communities that have lived like this for centuries. What we can do as we steadily make way into the steppe is work toward tilling and changing the land over the decades so as to make it more livable and more capable of supporting farms and settled communities. It won't be an easy task for the peasants doing this, but we are willing to fund the efforts as the results will be worth it in just a couple generations."
 at_the_edge_of_russia: "At the Edge of the Rus"
 at_the_edge_of_russia_desc: "To some back in Novgorod, Tver, Poltosk, and other Russian cities, Nizhny Novgorod is at the edge of civilization as they know it. Their knowledge of the lands beyond our frontier are scarce and lacking, but perhaps that is for the best for us. Nizhny Novgorod has been founded and raised up in these border region conditions, next to the steppe and consistently at the front of hostilities between settled and nomadic states. Learning to govern both types of people is by no means an easy task, but who is more capable than we are in this regard? None, that is who."

 #Ryazan Ideas#
 burned_twice_but_still_alive: "Burnt to Ash; Risen from Ash"
 burned_twice_but_still_alive_desc: "We have been invaded on multiple occasions even before the Mongol hordes came through and ravaged our land. Whether it was from Vladimir-Suzdal in the north or Cuman hordes in the south, Ryazan knew very little peace in its history; this reached a new level of destruction though when Batu Khan invaded and devastated our capital in December of 1237. But even despite all of these hardships we have been through, the people of Ryazan carry on and righteously defend what is their own. They know to never give up without a fight, not even when the odds are stacked against them in every direction. Men and women alike are ready to serve until death in defense of our independence."
 ready_to_relocate_the_capital: "A Mobile Capital"
 ready_to_relocate_the_capital_desc: "In the past, when Ryazan was sacked and burned by invading forces, we have had to move our capital to a different nearby town and go through the process of relocating nobility, peasants, and even things like stacks of manuscripts and valuable materials. This sort of 'life-on-the-road' mentality that has seeped into Ryazan is what helps our people and our administration build up infrastructure and suitable towns into more viable centers of administration; and should Ryazan be invaded so terribly as it was before, we might just need to move our base of operations once more."
 vladimir_suzdals_courageous_resistance: "Courage from Vladimir-Suzdal"
 vladimir_suzdals_courageous_resistance_desc: "Even though the old Grand Duchy of Vladimir-Suzdal invaded us on multiple occasions, they were one of the main sources of power in the Rus that stood up to the Mongol hordes in various battles, losing time and time again. Despite these losses and prior bad blood, Ryazan at times fought with Vladimir-Suzdal in order to preserve the independence of Russian people. It is this courage and valiant attitude that we will strive to emulate as we move forward, fighting on even if there is no clear victory in sight."
 the_skirmishes_against_pronsk: "The Old Feud with Pronsk"
 the_skirmishes_against_pronsk_desc: "Ryazan's feud with the town of Pronsk is an age-old one that refuses to be settled in courts or in diplomatic meetings. Skirmishes and open combat have been common throughout our history shared history, but still Pronsk sees itself as independent of Ryazan's politics and influence. In time, we will end this pretentious little area of ours and secure it through military occupation if need be, and the various battles we've fought against Pronsk will be remembered fondly by our military."
 mongol_military_influences_on_ryazan: "The Cavalry Arm of the Rus"
 mongol_military_influences_on_ryazan_desc: "Being that we are perhaps the closest to the wide open steppe, Ryazan is more suited to fielding cavalry-based armies than other places like Moscow, Novgorod, Tver, or Smolensk. Taking what we can learn from our experience with the devastating Mongol hordes and other steppe khanates, Ryazan's military has the potential to become something of a dominant force in the Rus and along places like the Don River and the Lower Volga."
 ready_to_take_the_don: "Settle the Don River"
 ready_to_take_the_don_desc: "A near and dear to the people of Ryazan and the steppe people near us, the Don River is vital for a number of reasons: trade, map making, fresh water, and even fortification construction. If we of Ryazan can take hold of the majority of the Don River and settle it with our own towns and villages with protections via constructed fortifications, the power we wield will grow immensely!"
 steppe_contacts_for_ryazan: "Steppe Contacts toward Ryazan"
 steppe_contacts_for_ryazan_desc: "Increasingly we are being contacted by steppe hordes from the east who are curious at the development of Ryazan as a whole. Gone are the days where strong khanates like the Golden Horde or the Khanate of Kazan would threaten the lands of the Rus without end, so now we are looking forward toward this new era of tense but good cooperation and diplomatic relations. The better friends we are with these steppe states, the more cavalry will be available to us in general and we will perhaps be able to expand our influence to new heights across the vast and open stretches of land to our east."

 #Pskov Ideas#
 daumantas_give_us_strength: "Daumantas Give Pskov Strength!"
 daumantas_give_us_strength_desc: "Glory be to he who is known as Timothy in Christianity, but in Pskov is known as the great Daumantas! Arriving in 1266 and dying in 1299, Daumantas had a bloody history with the Grand Duchy of Lithuania at the point when he arrived in Pskov. He rose to power quickly in Pskov and led the Pskovian military to victory against Lithuanian forces by the Daugava River. His story streches for years after this great battle what with Novgorod even being unable to rein him in during his lifetime and it is undoubtedly a life history that will be told without end in Pskov. Let his legacy give us strength and valor so that we may live to see an independent future!"
 the_pskov_charter: "The Pskov Charter, Reaffirmed"
 the_pskov_charter_desc: "The Pskov Charter has been around since 1397, but it is not an unchanging document. With input from the veche and princely decrees, it has changed shape over the decades to become a staple part of our state and must be protected by all in the administration. Within the documentation, it protects private property (feudal matters included), court examination of land disputes, and it also issues regulations for trade relations (such as buying, selling, loaning, and hiring people for work)."
 bridge_to_europe_outpost_of_russia: "As a Bridge, and an Outpost"
 bridge_to_europe_outpost_of_russia_desc: "Pskov sees itself in an interesting position when it comes to international politics since we are both a bridge and an outpost (the former being when viewed by Russians and the latter when being viewed from the west). What this helps ensure though is that Pskov has plenty of lucrative trade chances with Scandinavians, Germans, Russians, and Balts. So long as we don't disturb international politics too much, this situation should continue on without much of a hassle."
 the_bridge_that_is_fought_over: "Taking the Brunt of Wars"
 the_bridge_that_is_fought_over_desc: "Trade is not the only thing that comes to the heart of Pskov, for war is quite common for our area as well. Danish incursions in Estonia right to our west, Rus states battling it out our east, and the Baltic realm being thrashed by Teutonic and Lithuanian forces alike; all of this makes for Pskov seeing a great amount of action and being viewed as a strategic location for many monarchs and commanders. Perhaps we can leverage this view on Pskov for the better and ally ourselves with some strong states to help protect us as these wars rage on."
 stone_wall_the_capital: "Protecting Pskov's Heart"
 stone_wall_the_capital_desc: "We are not a fragile state since we have been hardened by repeated wars, but we are not nearly as strong as neighboring states, that much is clear. As such we need to ensure that our defenses (especially the ones around our capital) are well built and numerous, even when it comes to layered walls. If we have to build two, three, or even four stone walls around our capital to keep it safe from desolation, then we will do it!"
 flowering_of_mixing_art_styles: "Artisans of Pskov"
 flowering_of_mixing_art_styles_desc: "It is thanks to our history, geographic location, and special attention to trade over making military invasions elsewhere that Pskov is become a true center of artistry in a variety of forms. Whether it is in new structures built with a blend of styles from east and west, or whether it is the growing population of icon-makers in Pskov, we know just how valuable our artisans are to the prosperity of the state. In time, these works of art and beauty will bring in more profitable business for us whilst also ensuring a lasting legacy for future generations."
 refusal_of_estates_in_favor_of_the_republic: "Affirmation of the Republic"
 refusal_of_estates_in_favor_of_the_republic_desc: "How far we have come is a sign of Pskov's effective way of governance and attention to its citizens. Other states around us find it necessary to rely on unruly nobles to handle affairs around their realm, but Pskov is truly following in the model of Novgorod and utilizing the veche and other tactics to give the people of land a rightful say in politics. We must not let these principles go, not ever, not so long as Pskov lives on."

 playing_christian_religious_politics_desc: "Pope Innocent IV had Daniel I of Galicia crowned as king of the Rus in 1245, yet still the lands he governed over remained firmly independent of the Holy See in terms of ecclesiastic matters. Eastern Orthodoxy was still the religion of the people despite this gesture of goodness from the Papacy in the west, so what does that mean for our own future? It means we can play off both Catholics and Orthodox clergy through delegations and careful internal political assertions."

When we are not at war with any of these states, it would be wise for us to capitalize on the flowing trade in these transition towns and cities; they're lucrative and full of potential if they are protected with a firm military and a competent administration."

 composite_literature_making_desc: "We have in our lands people from all around us: Hungarians, Poles, Ruthenians, Lithuanians, and of course, Russians. Not only this, but we are seeing new populations slowly arrive inside Galicia-Volhynia too, meaning that they will bring their traditions of literature with them. Encouraging this growth of book writing and book publishing will help all facets of our society and it will even help our administration become more attuned to new innovations that spread across Europe."
 routine_hostilities_on_all_sides: "The Web of Friends and Enemies"
 routine_hostilities_on_all_sides_desc: "Since the inception of Galicia-Volhynia into a single state under Roman the Great (1152-1205), we have been tangled up in a web of hostile and friendly relations that switch around from time to time. Playing off the Polish to our north, the Hungarians to our southwest, the Lithuanians to our northeast, and the Tatars to our southeast has been nothing short of tiring to those of Galicia-Volhynia and indeed holding this geographical region down is a test for any serious ruler. Perhaps in time though, when we have another Roman the Great on our throne, we can exert ourselves once more and strike at our enemies, asserting our old claims as true and valid."
 the_mistake_of_andrew_ii_and_lev_ii: "Assurances of Heirs"
 the_mistake_of_andrew_ii_and_lev_ii_desc: "The mistake of Leo II and Andrew II during their lifetimes that doomed Galicia-Volhynia completely was the fact that neither left an heir in place for the state! Sources disagree on how and where they died in 1323, but the fact that they did effectively left the state to be governed by boyars and also partitioned by those surrounding the state. As we look toward a new future in this ever changing world, we must find a concrete way to get new heirs and ensure that the dynasty of Galicia-Volhynia is never in danger of dying out completely. If this can be done, more faith can be put into the state and its administration from the people."
 variety_of_populations_of_the_nation: "Come One Come All!"
 variety_of_populations_of_the_nation_desc: "Just as we are engaging in a blooming of new literature that combines elements from a variety of different cultures, we should also be engaging in taking a regular census for our cities and also looking to recognize the various people of Galicia-Volhynia. If we cannot or will not accept certain portions of people who have come to our land seeking refuge or opportunity, then how do we expect to survive as a growing state that comes to encompass vast swathes of people?"
 the_red_is_rigthfully_ours: "End the Contention"
 the_red_is_rigthfully_ours_desc: "We have come far in our journey from being set free once more. Whilst we still face a variety of threats around us, Galicia-Volhynia can and should become stronger than it ever was prior to the Mongol invasions. Settling contentions on our borders, especially over the Cherven Cities, is what should be our main goal now since the Polish, Lithuanians, and Hungarians are starting to realize that they can no longer push us around like they used to. It is time to play our hand!"

 #Golden Horde Ideas#
 revitalized_with_golden_vigor: "Revived, Renewed, and Ready"
 revitalized_with_golden_vigor_desc: "After the reign of Jani Beg ended in 1357, a steep decline took hold of the Golden Horde and civil strife consumed all parts of the administration. Whilst Tokhtamysh brought back some stability to the Golden Horde from 1381 to 1395, the precedent was set that unrest and breaking away from central authority was going to continue without end. These times of breaking down and being unable to control politics must be rectified if we are ever to become as strong as we once were; we must learn to control how succession works, how feuds are handled, and how politics stretching from town to town and region to region are handled. Our ancestors may not have been able to do this, but we certainly can."
 a_failed_past_for_a_brighter_future: "Stains in our Golden Past"
 a_failed_past_for_a_brighter_future_desc: "The old style of deciding politics and having sons or brothers flee to neighboring lands to ask support to retake the throne is something that was disastrous for our past khans. The latter part of the 1300s is rife with examples of how our khans could not keep a firm grip over things, but we are better than them in more ways than just one. Our borders are becoming more concrete, our administration is becoming more streamlined, and how we integrate new people into the lands of the Golden Horde is following in line with how those of the great Mongol Empire used to. Soon, none will be able to stop our advances in any direction."
 sweeping_cavalry_formations: "The Unleashed and Unbound Horde"
 sweeping_cavalry_formations_desc: "The resurgence of the Golden Horde is an alarming thing to many in Europe for a variety of reasons, but perhaps the most feared reason is that of our mighty cavalry armies. Even if we must strive to use gunpowder siege weapons alongside muskets, the military of the Golden Horde has its emphasis on what has carried its nomadic ancestors through the ages: cavalry. Few if any states around us can even come close to matching our mastery of cavalry tactics and that will be to our distinct advantage."
 what_sarai_imposes_on_us: "Sarai Berke, Emulated"
 what_sarai_imposes_on_us_desc: "New Sarai, or, as we call it 'Sarai Berke' was the heart of the Golden Horde in the past, serving as a trade hub and a political center in the steppe that could effectively govern a great amount of land in the hands of the right people. Though it has fallen from grace due to negligence and disruptions in politics throughout the decades, we can and will build it up once more. Not only this, but we will emulate its majesty and might in our other largest cities where we find trade and wealth thriving."
 sedentary_life_calls_to_us: "Settle the Land; Settle for the Future"
 sedentary_life_calls_to_us_desc: "In the days of old, Sarai Berke helped solidify the notion to many nomadic folks that settled life was the way forward. It called to many in the Golden Horde's administration for them to settle down and to cultivate a more rigid and robust state that could expand development internally, but unfortunately not everyone saw it this way and thus, diverging views sparked tension over time. At least today the facts of the matter are more clear than ever to the Golden Horde viziers and commanders: settled life is simply what will become the standard for more and more people inside its borders."
 islam_but_not_completely: "Steppe Version of Islam"
 islam_but_not_completely_desc: "Though the introduction of Islam to the Golden Horde was somewhat violent thanks to Oz Beg Khan killing Jochid princes and Buddhist lamas that opposed his adoption of Islam, it helped gather support across the state for his campaigns against the Ilkhanate in 1319, 1325, and 1335. After this adoption of Islam though, it wasn't enforced heavily through imams and strict legalist approaches; not even alcohol was banned by the Golden Horde back then. Just as it was back then, we too will take this relaxed approach to Islam as a state religion; we will not enforce it as heavily as some other states do, and we will not take every single doctrine of Islam to heart. Prosperity can be had even with kafirs and infidels."
 usage_of_the_yam_system_again: "Rekindle the Yam System"
 usage_of_the_yam_system_again_desc: "Relay stations for messengers, that is in essence what the old yam system was. It allowed for armies, communication, civilians, and officials to travel to and from places efficiently so that the administration could keep up with the pace of conquests going outward from the Mongol Empire. We of the Golden Horde would be fools not to use such a system again for the vast stretches of land we have across the steppe; we could even improve parts of it when and where see fit, just so long as the funding is available."

 #Aragonese Ideas#
 legacy_of_the_catalan_company: "Legacy of the Catalan Company"
 legacy_of_the_catalan_company_desc: "Mercenaries, an age-old concept that has graced the bloody fields of battle for generations upon generations. For us of Aragon, the Catalan Company had a great deal of influence on our rise as they were formed because of almogavar veterans that were unemployed after the War of the Sicilian Vespers. They did not serve us at every single point, but they left us of Aragon a true legacy to live up to in terms of hiring and continuing alongside mercenaries in general. Whenever we need an extra bit of impact in a war of any kind, we can always pay for a bit more backing."
 western_mediterranean_dominance: "Western Mediterranean Dominance"
 western_mediterranean_dominance_desc: "Situated as we are and with how influential we have been over places like Sardinia, Corsica, Sicily, and especially Iberian coasts in the east, we stand to benefit from focusing greatly on our naval prowess so that we can dominate the sea for trade purposes. Of course others will contest our dominance in this part of the Mediterranean, but if we employ capabal sailors with strong ship designs, few will be able to actually dethrone us from where we sit as holder of the 'Consulate of the Sea'."
 learn_from_the_union_of_aragon: "Lessons from the Union of Aragon"
 learn_from_the_union_of_aragon_desc: "The late 1200s saw perhaps the greatest devolution in crown authority for Aragon as a whole. The Union of Aragon was formed as a result of Peter III's annexation of Sicily and Pope Martin IV taking firm action against him, leading to a great deal of chaos that included the nobles of the land rising up and forcing his successor, Alfonso III, to accept conditions that let lesser nobles take part in the traditional power structure of the Crown of Aragon. It was disastrous and let the state lapse further and further downward, something we wish to never see again for the good of all of Aragon. If this means we have to cut down the power of the nobles in a variety of ways and through various laws, then we will do so and seek to empower the crown altogether."
 core_kingdoms_into_one_crown: "Core Kingdoms, One Crown"
 core_kingdoms_into_one_crown_desc: "We are not a singular kingdom in reality. Under the Crown of Aragon there are constituent kingdoms that form our basis of power, some of them being: The Principality of Catalonia, the Kingdom of Valencia, the Kingdom of Majorca, and of course, the Kingdom of Aragon itself. The more we can tie these kingdoms into one nice and neat power structure under one crown, the more secure our people will feel no matter where they are."
 petty_kingdoms_for_economic_gain: "Petty Crowns"
 petty_kingdoms_for_economic_gain_desc: "Whilst we have core kingdoms in Iberia and such, Aragon is not without its need for lesser crowns beneath it in places such as the Italian Peninsula. Formalizing the obligations they have to the Crown of Aragon and ensuring that they serve our economic interests instead of others is what will be the focus of them, and if the Papacy or some other force seeks to break them away from us, we will retaliate with the utmost force from the shores of Iberia and all other lands we hold."
 utiliz_the_fueros_in_conquest: "Fueros?"
 utiliz_the_fueros_in_conquest_desc: "To govern local life, especially in recently conquered land, is something that is very hard to do in any state. A strong and sound administration alongside a ready and willing military force is key to locking local places down, yet giving them some autonomy and formalizing local laws is also needed so as to keep them productive and at least somewhat happy. That is where the fueros of Aragon come into play as we have used them before when conquering lands in Iberia, but they were less formalized than what we truly want. Making it an ongoing process to keep the fueros in a state of refinement so that local communities are not suppressed will integrate people to a much faster degree into our state."
 aragonese_protectionism: "Instill Protectionism"
 aragonese_protectionism_desc: "Being flexible on our diplomacy and our trade policy is key to maintaining the prominence of Aragon in Europe, but is it enough? Mercantile matters are increasingly becoming the focus of our administration since we can make a great deal of money off of the flow of trade which is why many in our court are suggesting we instill some sort of protectionism for Aragonese lands as a whole. It would be a dangerous experiment sure since it could mess with how much income we see from trade overall, but it could also grant us untold amounts of influence."

 #Castilian Ideas#
 from_border_region_to_kingdom: "The Past of Castile"
 from_border_region_to_kingdom_desc: "Origins can feel like distant memories to many, but for us of Castile, they are foundations on which we build our current reputation and might off of. Castile's origins lay in it being originally a militarized border region between the Kingdom of Asturias and the Muslims of al-Andalus, but it was the work of Fernan Gonzalez that paved the way for Castile to become a power to rival that of Leon later on. We must never forget these turbulent yet fruitful years of our foundation, not when we still have enemies in many directions to contend with."
 dynastic_bickering_remnants: "Castile's Dynastic Interests"
 dynastic_bickering_remnants_desc: "Inside of Castile and outside throughout Europe, dynastic fluctuations are impacting the great states of Europe without end. Even when we think we're safe, we can see the minor dynasties inside Castile moving their metaphorical chess pieces around so that they might undermine our authority or gain more power for themselves. Instead of looking to crush these minor dynasties outright and trying to smite down any sort of local authority figures, we should work with them and gain their trust and loyalty. The more we can placate them into a soft and submissive stance, the better off we will be internally and externally."
 utilize_the_religious_orders: "The Orders of Calatrava, Alcantara, and Santiago"
 utilize_the_religious_orders_desc: "The rise of the Castile and its ever faithful monarchs throughout the centuries has meant that Christian holy orders were bound to rise up as well. The Order of Calatrava (founded in 1164), the Order of Alcantara (founded in 1166), and the Order of Santiago (founded in about 1170) all play minor but crucial roles in the administration of Castilian land and the enforcement of religious matters across our land. Though they are not quite an inquisition of sorts, they routinely prove to be useful for our religious efforts, especially when we are at war with heretics and heathens alike."
 ordained_to_expand: "By God's Will!"
 ordained_to_expand_desc: "Some may not see us as being chosen by God or chosen by the Holy See to expand overseas and across to different places of the world, but we do not need this recognition from other European monarchs and states. Castile's own royalty and administration know full well that Christians both near and far approve of our expansion both near and far; getting special approval from the Holy See is merely the official seal on things that will make the point stick even harder."
 local_councils_of_cabildos: "Cabildos of Castile"
 local_councils_of_cabildos_desc: "In these new lands that we conquer and colonize, we must work toward establishing a sort of local administration that can organize matters so that officials of higher status can administrate things properly. Forming these sorts of 'cabildos' in freshly taken lands will help satiate things for the time being, but we should always be on the lookout for how we can improve them for the future."
 enforcement_of_christian_supremacy: "All for the Church; Nothing outside of the Church"
 enforcement_of_christian_supremacy_desc: "If it isn't bad enough that the rest of Europe outside of Iberia seems to be in the midst of religious civil war, we must also contend with the fact that some of these heretics think that Iberia is place where their ideas might be welcome! This simply cannot stand and we will work to enforce religious order in Castile via something not many would expect out of us, considering we already holy orders at the ready: An inquisition! And one that officially backed by the Castilian administration at that! Through this religious arm of ours, we will be able to maintain absolute Christian authority in these lands of ours."
 settle_a_formal_capital: "Which Capital of Castile?"
 settle_a_formal_capital_desc: "Since Castile's founding, it might be embarrassing to say but... We haven't had a formal capital in a long time. Traditionally the capital of Castile has been wherever the king chose to stay at; if he chose to stay in Madrid, Toledo, or Burgos, the cortes was there and so was the capital. Since we are growing larger than ever before and we are starting to expand several parts of our administration to handle the vast stretches of land we hold, it would be wise to settle down a formal capital for ourselves so that administrative matters can be more streamlined and we don't have to worry about travel issues and having to move suddenly if the current monarch suddenly dies."

 #Ashikaga Ideas#
 ashikaga_takauijis_legacy: "Legacy of Ashikaga Takauji"
 ashikaga_takauijis_legacy_desc: "Male descendant of the Seiwa Genji line and destroyer of the Kamakura Shogunate, Ashikaga Takauji was originally a general of the Kamakura Shogunate. He served valiantly in the Genko War of 1331, but later on he helped banish Emperor Go-Daigo and seize Kyoto itself after becoming disillusioned with the Kamakura Shogunate. After taking Kamakura (the city) itself, he established the Ashikaga Shogunate in 1336 and increasingly earned respect and prestige for the shogunate during his lifetime. Though his life is long gone by now, we still channel much of his prowess in diplomacy and military in order to garner favorable support from our subordinates."
 reduction_of_imperial_power: "Imperial Threats No More!"
 reduction_of_imperial_power_desc: "We lack the established land holdings that the Kamakura Shogunate did before us, yet our base of power is set up in Kyoto itself instead of elsewhere so that we can ensure there is very little the imperial court itself can do against us. With the emperor weakened and no longer a threat to the Ashikaga Shogunate in general, we can pursue other prospects for our military-oriented administration and know that we are safe from ever breaking down into a period akin to the Nanboku-cho Period."
 higashiyama_and_kano_painting: "Higashiyama Culture & Kano Paintings"
 higashiyama_and_kano_painting_desc: "The earlier style of Kitayama Culture is fading away and the new wave of Zen Buddhist aesthetics is coming upon our land. Emphasizing aspects like chado (the tea ceremony), ikebana (flower arranging), Noh drama, and sumi-e ink painting, this new era of Higashiyama Culture alongside the emerging Kano school of painting will help give new cultural life to the shogunate whilst also attracting a great deal of artisans from all walks of life."
 shugo_and_bugyo_reining_in: "The Shugo and Bugyo Positions"
 shugo_and_bugyo_reining_in_desc: "From positions of local authority to provincial governors themselves, these bugyo and shugo positions of power have been a source of constant tension inside the Ashikaga Shogunate. Time and time again our shoguns have had resources siphoned away by these local authorities who would rather serve their own purposes than that which the shogunate desires. As each one dies out or becomes a target of corruption, we should replace them with officials that stem from the Ashikaga Clan or those from our cadet branches who are actually loyal to Kyoto."
 the_five_mountain_system_strengthened: "The Five Mountain System"
 the_five_mountain_system_strengthened_desc: "The Five Mountain System is a system of Buddhist temples in Kyoto and Kamakura (five in each for a total of ten) that greatly help in administrating the land we directly control. From Tenryu-ji to Jomyo-ji, these temples have disciplined and skilled monks that aid in the running of Ashikaga affairs whilst also helping keep the clan itself together. With these temples and our continual patronage toward the Rinzai school of Buddhism that they follow, we will be able to properly keep our personal land in check."
 organizing_the_hokoshu_and_bugyoshu: "Hokoshu & Bugyoshu Reformation"
 organizing_the_hokoshu_and_bugyoshu_desc: "Military officials loyal directly to the Ashikaga Shogunate itself, these are the Hokoshu; magistrates and officials appointed directly by the Ashikaga Clan, these are the bugyoshu. For too long these positions have been few in number and lacking in their discipline, meaning that effective control over local affairs in our own land and the guarding of our land from invaders has been lacking to a great degree. Instituting a series of reforms to enlargen these posts with a greater selection of strong-willed and skillful people will open the doors to more functional Ashikaga domains."
 build_upon_shikimoku_and_goseibai_shikimoku: "Shikimoku and Goseibai-Shikimoku Revisions"
 build_upon_shikimoku_and_goseibai_shikimoku_desc: "In the beginning of the Ashikaga Shogunate, Ashikaga Takauji put forth the Kenmu Shikimoku and the Goseibai-Shikimoku as law codes to govern the land of the new shogunate. Being largely based in the Kamakura Shogunate's era of governance, these law codes are becoming more and more outdated with each passing year. Gathering a proper council of sorts to pass new legislation with regards to reforming these old law codes, or perhaps even drawing up new law codes in general, could breathe new life into our administration for the coming generations."

 #Punjab Ideas#
 five_rivers_of_the_great_indus: "Five Rivers into One Indus"
 five_rivers_of_the_great_indus_desc: "There are five rivers in the north that flow into one main heart that is the Indus River, going southward and giving fresh irrigation to a variety of people and communities that have thrived here for centuries without end. Punjab can be said to be where the Indus River starts its journey, and it is here that some of the most valuable lands by the Indus River are found. Thus, we will have an easier time developing them upward into something resembling an urbanized region as we go on."
 gateway_to_bharat_and_iran: "Into and Out of Punjab"
 gateway_to_bharat_and_iran_desc: "Punjab is a place of movements into and out of Bharat's northwestern sector. Being that it is lucrative for development, trade routes, and military strategies from various states in general, it would be wise to capitalize on these alluring aspects of our region. We can take in new ideas from afar and bolster our own revenue stream if we simply play our cards right in the various shifts of international politics."
 honest_work_of_sufi_saints: "Through Spiritual Works"
 honest_work_of_sufi_saints_desc: "Our proximity to Iranian lands has been met with hostilities at times, yet it has also allowed for a great deal of sufi saints to make their way into Punjab. These various sufis are hailed by many locals as hard workers, benevolent individuals, and graciously pious in their ways despite whatever political shifts happened above. Despite how Punjab has developed around Sikhism today, we should still give honor and thanks to the sufis of the past and present as the work they do is still very key to having Punjab stay together."
 cultivate_this_granary_of_bharat: "'Granary of Bharat'"
 cultivate_this_granary_of_bharat_desc: "Various foreigners and merchants have given the name 'granary of Bharat' to the Punjab region and that isn't without merit; we do produce a great amount of crops every single year and it was helps us influence the trade routes around us. If we can get the farmers and their respective plots of land to use more innovative irrigation methods whilst we of the administration reform how we deal out plots of land as a whole, we will be able to ensure that the production of various goods in Punjabi lands is never in doubt."
 militant_sikh_communities_in_use: "Rise of Militancy"
 militant_sikh_communities_in_use_desc: "Firearms, centralization, and even religious tensions growing ever more intricate, all of these factors and more play a role in how Punjab's communities are developing as a whole. We are seeing widespread militant ideas coming to the attention of our administration and often times skirmishes in rural areas near foreign borders with Punjab are taken care of by these militant communities instead of our actual regiments of soldiers. We need to reach out and work with these militant Punjabis so as to prevent unintended future conflicts and to bolster our own military ranks."
 centralization_instead_of_confederacy: "Common Causes and Common Customs"
 centralization_instead_of_confederacy_desc: "Once we have established a firm grasp on the militant locals and religious matters inside Punjab, making these various Punjabi people and their neighboring cultures see eye-to-eye is something that will take a very long time. Yet it is a project spanning generations of time that we of Punjab are willing to undertake so that we can have a formalized administration without the need for harsh reprisals or increasingly shady ties through advisors and royal families."
 to_defend_sikhism_is_to_defend_punjab: "Defenders of Sikhism; Defenders of Punjab"
 to_defend_sikhism_is_to_defend_punjab_desc: "It has never been in doubt that Sikhism is what underpins much of the Punjabi unity we enjoy today. It is a small religious movement compared to the pious giant that is Islam and the wise titan that is Hinduism, but it is not without its vehement supporters and ardent defenders. Going forward, Sikhism will continue to play a central role in Punjabi affairs both on a local and administrative level, and the Sikh warriors that vow to defend the faith will be welcomed into Punjabi military ranks as well. Their discipline is not just for the movement founded by Guru Nanak, it is for all of Punjab."

 #Afghanistan Ideas#
 loya_jirga_of_ages_past:  "Loya Jirga"
 loya_jirga_of_ages_past_desc: "Within our tribal system of loyalties and hierarchy, the loya jirga is a special assembly convened in the case of a sudden and unexpected change in governance (death, rebellion, code of laws being changed, etc.). Through consulting the loya jirga regularly when we know there is a major shift in governance happening, we will secure a much stronger base of loyalty amongst our various people as they know intrinsically that such an assembly of the people is needed in order to properly ordain that which rules the Pashtun people."
 pashtunwali_stays_true: "The Code of Life: Pashtunwali"
 pashtunwali_stays_true_desc: "What has been the main part of our way of life for centuries upon centuries now is something that all Iranians should look to for guidance to some degree. Pashtunwali stipulates four main principles: Hospitality, Asylum, Justice, and Revenge. There are other facets of Pashtunwali that we adhere to like arbitration and respect, yet those first four are the foundational principles that we should go by. And when an invader seeks to do us wrong by tarnishing our land and our state, we will enact righteous justice and revenge upon them."
 practice_hit_and_run_in_the_hindu_kush: "Hit-and-Run!"
 practice_hit_and_run_in_the_hindu_kush_desc: "We cannot rely on large standing armies full of professional soldiers; our land and our state is simply not built for such measures. What we are much more inclined to do is to levy troops from various tribes for battle and call upon tribal mercenaries when we can for extra support, and what both groups tend to specialize in is hit-and-run tactics. The introduction of firearms has made doing such hit-and-run maneuvers much easier, thus allowing our military forces to strike quicker and more deadly blows against the enemy."
 ghulams_spread_throughout: "Ghulams Far and Wide"
 ghulams_spread_throughout_desc: "They are stretched far across our homeland and beyond, serving as mercenaries or slave-soldiers for various political entities who can give them money, aid, and work; they are the ghulams. Pashtun leaders are no stranger to ghulams as they have become integral to making sure that the heartland of the Pashtun people stays safe, and integrating them bit by bit into our growing Pashtun state will help reduce the cost of hiring them for future campaigns."
 internal_disputes_without_end: "Never Ending Issues"
 internal_disputes_without_end_desc: "Despite what we do to cultivate a strong state for the Pashtun people, tribal feuds and disloyal locals continue to plague our administration. Often times we have tried to reason with these tribes of our land since they are also Pashtun most of the time, but we have seen quite a few of these attempts fall through and result in outright violent uprisings against us. Such revolts in the future will be seen as enemies of the state entirely and we will use every resource available to us to rein in these misguided fools."
 remember_to_consult_the_tribal_council: "Never Forget the Origins"
 remember_to_consult_the_tribal_council_desc: "What must never be forgotten as time goes on is to consult the tribal council itself that is central to whatever Pashtun state rules over the land, for it is from the tribal council that partly where the administration derives its power from. By including the tribal council on various decisions from economic policies to trade deals and military spending, the Pashtun people will know that they are being listened to in full."
 masterful_defensive_plays: "The Hindu Kush Defense"
 masterful_defensive_plays_desc: "We do not live where it is easy to thrive and succeed, but rather where life is tested to its very limits with each passing generation. Some valleys are rife with life and opportunity, yes, but most places in the Hindu Kush mountains are hard to traverse, full of blazing heat, thin air, and sometimes even biting cold. Such conditions will make our defensive positions in the Hindu Kush mountains all the more favorable, and enemy seeking to root out the Pashtun people will need to shed more blood than they ever thought possible in order to do so."

 the_spread_of_qizilbash: "To Tame the Qizilbash"
 the_spread_of_qizilbash_desc: "The spread of Shiite Islam throughout Mesopotamia and Iran has had a great amount of influence on not only politics across the land, but also on the local people who arm themselves and fight for various dynasties. Coming into our service as of late are the so-called 'Qizilbash' who are mainly Turkoman in origin and Shiite in religion; their weapons lent to the various sufi orders of the land have helped them become prominent forces all throughout Iran. Utilizing their military prowess throughout our land is what can and will propel us further than ever before, yet we must be wary of how influential they truly are as our politics evolve."
 pahlevani_and_zourkhaneh: "Pahlevani and Zourkhaneh"
 pahlevani_and_zourkhaneh_desc: "Iranian wrestling and various forms of close combat have had a place in Iranian culture for centuries upon centuries; even the invasion of Arabs in 637 could not stop Iranian people from practicing this sort of martial training despite the targeting of places where Iranians would practice in private. Though it has changed quite a bit as of today with Islamic elements being now integral to the practices of pahlevani inside our many zourkhaneh (translated as 'houses of strength'), these various forms of strength training for military and our civilians is what will help sustain our martial skill as time goes on."

 details_within_evolving_archiecture_desc: "There is no denying that as the Iranian people continue to thrive and take in new ideas from every direction, changes in politics and philosophy will come about that reflect the changes on the societal level. Yet, it is not just the intangible that changes as we Iranians do, but it is also the tangible elements of architecture that change too. Our mosques and gardens utilize local materials and local traditions to help give the structure a uniquely blended style, adding to the flourishing culture across all of Iran. Consequently, this usage of local materials and traditions also cuts down on the expenses we need to use for taking on such ambitious building projects."

 per_edge_defense_instead_of_inner_defense_desc: "The mountains of Iran are not invincible; the Arab invasion of 637 proved that fact to us. Still, they are a great natural barrier to invaders coming through, and the edges of our state are at a far greater risk of enemy invasion than the heart of our land in cities like Tehran and Isfahan. Establishing a stronger presence in these far territories of ours and keeping the locals in these far reaches under a closer watch will help keep our state alert and ready in the future."
 per_the_growth_of_carpet_making: "Unmatched Carpet Quality"
 per_the_growth_of_carpet_making_desc: "The weaving of carpets has been in Iranian history for generations as we all know, but we are now witnessing perhaps one of the greatest explosions in creativity for the art of carpet weaving. New patterns include carpets with spiral/tendril designs, floral ornaments, the depiction of flowers and animals, and some even achieve a mirrored design for an added layer of beauty. Truly these works of art are going to be sold for great amounts and this streamlining of the carpet making process is going to ensure that our economic prospects are never in doubt for the future."
 per_gholams_tofangchis_shahsevans_and_artillery: "Gholams, Tofangchis, Shahsevans, and Tupchi"
 per_gholams_tofangchis_shahsevans_and_artillery_desc: "We have a great amount of Christians from the Caucuses inside our state and they have proven to be useful as a special military branch called the 'gholam', but we must be wary of how they influence our state politics across generations. If we create other branches to go alongside the gholam, then we will be able to balance things out politically and also incorporate more gunpowder weapons into our military. Three other main branches can and will be put forth: the Shahsevans (friends of the king), the Tofangchis (musketeers), and the Tupchi (artillery-men); through these four branches, we will become a truly modern military power."
 per_safe_travels_and_safe_visits: "Travel in Peace"
 per_safe_travels_and_safe_visits_desc: "Throughout the lands of Arabia, Anatolia, the Levant, and Iran too, the various caravanserais make it so that people can travel for long stretches and make periodic stops to trade goods, get food and water, and also identify where exactly they are in the region. Those of our land, however, are larger in scope and placed in strategic locations across our lands alongside guards who collect road tolls so that traders and visitors passing through have an easier time getting from place to place in peace. It can be said that if one ensures the safety of traders and travellers throughout their land, prosperity in turn is also ensured."

 lur_kurdish_allies: "Ally the Tribes"
 lur_kurdish_allies_desc: "To our west in Mesopotamia, we see a variety of changes taking place over time. Kurdish tribes migrate, Arabian bands of people move around, and even Turkic people move through and sometimes settle down. What we observe regularly though is the increasing presence of Kurdish tribes in the region thanks to us securing the heartland of Iran to the east of Mesopotamia. If we can reliably ally these Kurdish tribes and bring them closer to our administration, we will have a great source of devoted fighters for our future conflicts, especially in western areas like the Levant and Arabia."
 lur_rigid_defensive_stance: "Staunch Iranian Defenses"
 lur_rigid_defensive_stance_desc: "The gates into Iranian heartland are marked by high mountains and narrow paths that snake through the elevated slopes and passages. If one is to truly invade Iranian cities like Isfahan and Tehran, they will need to break through these natural gates of stone that nature has put forth for us. It is in this grand defensive nature that we can find refuge in the most dire times."
 lur_diminshed_religious_rigidity: "Fluidity in Religious Practice"
 lur_diminshed_religious_rigidity_desc: "We can learn much from the more spaced out people of Iran such as the Lurs. For far too long now there has been a sense of strict religiosity across the lands from Tabriz to Herat; it causes divides and struggles between muftis, imams, and whole communities that could otherwise be avoided entirely if a more practical approach to religion was taken. As we come to power in future decades, we will take steps to emphasize local practices and traditions with regards to religion so as to dampen the flames of religious zealotry in our land. If we can garner the loyalty of our own faithful people regardless of their exact theology, then we will be able to bend the greater religious institutions to our own will."
 lur_open_to_different_politics: "Politics of a Different Sort"
 lur_open_to_different_politics_desc: "Being that Iran has a variety of different Iranian branches of people encompassing its greatest cities and its halls of power, it would seem natural that different politics arise in the various areas under our authority. Indeed this is what we see as some places retain a tribal hierarchy and some places retain a much more theocratic hierarchy. Learning to adapt these politics toward our central administration and meeting the various people half way with regards to what can and should be done for them will help bring a sense of peace and stability to our lands."

 maz_cradle_of_iranian_agriculture: "Emphasize Iranian Agriculture"
 maz_cradle_of_iranian_agriculture_desc: "Many think of the land of the Iranian people as deficient in agriculuture and food production, but those people do not know about the lucrative lands at the southern coast of the Caspian Sea. These lands are havens for farmers and land owners alike as they produce some of the most valuable crops in all of our land, all whilst remaining productive at regular intervals year after year. Cultivating this region further with new technologies will only serve to bolster our grain reserves and food markets."
 maz_dabuyid_memories: "Dabuyid Descendant Memories"
 maz_dabuyid_memories_desc: "The transition out of the Sassanian Empire and into the era of Islam for Iranian people was one rife with chaos and instability. For those of the north, the Dabuyids and their descendant dynasties that were the Qarinvandids and Bavandids resisted the invasion of Muslims for generations before finally losing it all in their revolt agianst the Abbasid Caliphate around 783. Despite their losses and the fading grandeur of the Dabuyid descendants, we still revere the efforts of these noble lineages through tombs and monuments alike. Recognizing the greatness of our own past in recent times will ensure the populace that we are not ignorant of their extensive history."
 maz_caspian_trade_routes: "Look to the North"
 maz_caspian_trade_routes_desc: "Trade in the southern reaches of what is traditionally held as Iranian land is becoming harder and harder to profit from since Arabian tribes and foreign powers are making life for traders less than lucrative. In the north, though, we have untapped potential in trade routes across the Caspian Sea. Building a few more ports and sustaining a few more docks on what we control of the Caspian Sea could land us some very prosperous trade deals compared to what we can obtain in the south."
 maz_old_autonomous_tributary_status: "Knowledge of Subject Obligations"
 maz_old_autonomous_tributary_status_desc: "Though the descendants of the Dabuyids were subjugated by the Abbasid Caliphate, the caliphs neglected to truly make the lands of the Qarinvandids and Bavandids subjects of the caliphate; instead the lands were almost completely autonomous and pledged fealty to the caliphate in name only for generations without end. It is this kind of fully autonomous subject-overlord relationship that we must overcome in the future if we are to cultivate stronger diplomatic and administrative influence. We will be unlike the Abbasid Caliphate of the past as they tried to rein in Iranian lands; we will rectify what subject-overlord contracts we must to ensure we get what belongs to us."

 kur_independent_kurdish_fighting_experiences: "Complex Battle Memories"
 kur_independent_kurdish_fighting_experiences_desc: "From the Shaddadids to the Marwanids, and from the Hasanwayhids to the Ayyubids, Kurdish people and indeed the western edge of Iranian people in general have cultivated great amounts of influence in places across the Islamic world, but the light of these western expansions has been halted for a great amount of time now. Still, the memories of intense warfare and struggles for power remain in the various tribes and groups of Iranian people in the west; we would do well to harness their might in the form of an expanded military wing focused on securing and expanding into places like the Levant, Arabia, and Egypt."
 kur_various_interpretations_of_religion: "Religious Interpretations Spread"
 kur_various_interpretations_of_religion_desc: "The way various people of our land interpret theology, philosophy, and even morale values themselves is subject to change depending on where one goes. In some places, Shiite Islam under a certain school of jurisprudence may reign supreme; in others, Yazidi beliefs permeate the scattered people of the land; and yet in still other places, Christianity is spread alongside Islamic and Jewish beliefs. Recognizing and attempting a policy of cooperation with these various religious communities that do not follow what our state holds as true can and will lead us to greener pastures in the future, but we cannot falter in this effort for unity and recognition."
 kur_the_writing_of_old_stories: "Old Tales, Materialized"
 kur_the_writing_of_old_stories_desc: "So many people of Iranian descent have stories passed down to them from generation to generation, but where can these stories be found if say, a Kurdish person wished to learn about a story from a Baluchi person? Currently there is no place to learn such stories, but that will soon change! We will undertake an effort to start writing down these legends and myths of old into tomes and books so that future generations may read them without trouble, and so that the memories of ancestors can be preserved despite the loss of elders over time."
 kur_refine_the_handicrafts: "Iranian Wares Refined"
 kur_refine_the_handicrafts_desc: "Whilst we are experts in crafting certain objects and goods for trade purposes, we can get complacent in this lofty position of artistic flourishing. We should work toward patronizing more artisans and looking toward new ways of making certain goods that we are known for making so that we can continue to be on top of the world in terms of valued commodities. From new ways to refine wood to new methods of securing dyes from plants, all of it will go toward bolstering our expertise in artisan goods."

 kho_the_emirs_put_to_work: "Record Keeping & Internal Dynasties"
 kho_the_emirs_put_to_work_desc: "The lands of the Iranian people have a long history of internal dynasties of nobles and rulers, some of which have died out as the generations passed them by. Still though, we see several dynasties that rule parts of our land that can trace their ancestry all the way back to the times of the Abbasid Caliphate and before! Truly these families deserve a great degree of attention and respect, but they also deserve a great amount of work to keep them from usurping our hold on power. With the great dynasties inside our realm under lock-and-key, we shall be all the more centralized as time goes on."
 kho_distribute_forces_evenly: "Four Directions, Four Paths"
 kho_distribute_forces_evenly_desc: "Iranian land is but an island surrounded by paths of conquest and invasion, is it not? Westward is the lands of Anatolia and the Levant; southward is the land of the Arabs; northward is home to the herders of the steppe; and eastward is the gateway toward Hindustan itself. Maintaining our presence on all four fronts is going to require a serious amount of logistal support and road building, both of which we Iranians are adept at working toward should internal stability grace our administration."
 kho_muftis_imams_and_sufis_of_iran: "Sufi Orders & Foreign Patrons"
 kho_muftis_imams_and_sufis_of_iran_desc: "Religious figures in Iranian history are widespread and Islam's interesting history with Iranian people over the generations has given birth to a myriad of interpretations and schools of thought. The sufi orders in particular are perhaps some of the most well known parts of our Islamic history. From the Chishti Order to the Ni'matullahi Order, and from the Shattari Order to the Safaviyya Order, they have followers all across our land and beyond, particularly in the lands to our east in the subcontinent of Hindustan. Wealthy patrons from there including sultans and nawabs alike fund the sufi orders of our land via patronage for sufi members to visit and settle down, thus invigorating the religiosity of our state even more."
 kho_cross_continent_traders: "Lucrative Trade of Iranian Land"
 kho_cross_continent_traders_desc: "With our religious fervor rising, our affinity for stable income rises as well. The stability brought forth by our state in recent times has given rise to a rising amount of traders coming from the east and west, meaning we are gaining influence in both directions with regards to influence. If we can build more roads and keep our lands free from devastation in future decades, we will likely never run low on wealth in general, nor will we ever see an end to our growing influence."

 afg_the_four_tribes_that_dominate: "The Sarbani, Bettani, Gharghashti, and the Karlani"
 afg_the_four_tribes_that_dominate_desc: "Within the lands of the Hindu Kush and the general region that is known for harboring Pashtun tribes, there are four tribal confederacies that dominate politics: The Sarbani, Bettani, the Gharghashti, and the Karlani. Despite them having feuds and differences that broke down relations in the past, we have been able to resolve a great many of them since our unification into a single state, meaning we can recruit intellectuals and well read individuals from each group. So long as we continue to respect their traditions and their highest ranking people, we will have their support."
 afg_pashtunwali: "The Code of Life: Pashtunwali"
 afg_pashtunwali_desc: "What has been the main part of our way of life for centuries upon centuries now is something that all Iranians should look to for guidance to some degree. Pashtunwali stipulates four main principles: Hospitality, Asylum, Justice, and Revenge. There are other facets of Pashtunwali that we adhere to like arbitration and respect, yet those first four are the foundational principles that we should go by. And when an invader seeks to do us wrong by tarnishing our land and our state, we will enact righteous justice and revenge upon them."
 afg_poetry_and_literature_of_iran: "Upbringing of Iranian Literature"
 afg_poetry_and_literature_of_iran_desc: "As we learn about new ideas and innovations from far off lands, they become integral to both rural and urban parts of Iranian society. Not even the remote places in the Hindu Kush are safe from the coming tide of new assets and commodities, yet what is done with them by the writers and poets of our land is what will help these changes last forever. Encouraging the writing and copying of various Iranian books and manuscripts so that more may learn about various fields of study like agriculture, astronomy, mathematics, and philosophy will be key in solidifying our place in the world."
 afg_a_prepared_empire: "Establish Iranian Dominance"
 afg_a_prepared_empire_desc: "We have trudged through generations of factionalism and civil strife, but Iranians have always seen a light at the end of this daunting tunnel. We must take solace in the fact that we have overcome so many challenges and hardships, and as we recover our strength through building up towns and developing our own infrastructure, we will set our sights on the various regions where Iranian people once dominated. We will not be denied what rightfull belongs to us! We will follow in the steps of our ancestors and usher in a new age of Iranian dominance!"

 bal_emphasis_on_logistics: "Supplies and Logistics"
 bal_emphasis_on_logistics_desc: "If there is one thing that living in this region has taught us, it is that going without an assured supply of food, water, and materials is a death sentence. That is exactly why we are so keen on providing our own soldiers and civilians checkpoints and rest areas so that they can gather what they need before moving on. If we can maintain our own health internally, we will be better prepared to strike against our enemies when the time is right."
 bal_swift_skirmishing: "Skirmish to the End"
 bal_swift_skirmishing_desc: "Arid lands like ours (save for the southern edge of the Caspian Sea) are rife with opportunities to have small, compact battles of a few thousand soldiers instead of massive armies ranging in the hundreds of thousands. It is this upbringing of ours with regards to emphasizing skirmishes over pitched battles that has led to how we fight today for Iranian land: swift movements, lightly armored cavalry, and putting our infantry in key positions so that they can be withstand the massed attacks of our enemies."
 bal_tombs_to_the_past: "Mausoleums and Tombs"
 bal_tombs_to_the_past_desc: "The influences of previous conquerors and leaders who came through Iranian land ensured that we would be a region of regal art and architecture. Yet, these structures honor not only the divine and the currently living, but they also are fit for our past rulers who made our state what it is. Whether they are made of sandstone, limestone, or even marble, we will make sure that the various graves to our ancestors are revered by all in our state and that they are safe pilgramage sites for generations to come."
 bal_moving_toward_non_religious_politics: "Religious and Secular Matters"
 bal_moving_toward_non_religious_politics_desc: "Islam's influence across the various Iranian people who survive to this day is unmatched. Zoroastrian traditions are scattered throughout various pockets of our land too just as Hindu celebrations and ceremonies fill in niche parts of our eastern, but all too often these various religious influences clash due to zealous clerics and nobles try to force their faith on to others. Perhaps it is time we work to cleanse our politics of these religious tones and bloodshed; it could help stabilize the state and serve as a catalyst to help resolve age-old disputes that were emboldened by official religious backing."

 aze_tumultuous_arab_iranian_history: "Arab-Iranian Conflicts"
 aze_tumultuous_arab_iranian_history_desc: "With how the Sassanid Empire of the past fell to Arab invasion, it should not be surprising that the remnants of the old Zoroastrian state that held out elsewhere gave it their all to resist encroaching Arab invaders. Through centuries of victories and defeats on both sides, dynastic lineages have crossed over and several claims to legitimacy are hazy at best, but that does not impede our progress as a unified Iranian state. These conflicts that in turn bred the mixing of Arabian and Iranian cultures has given us ample fuel for conquest both in the form of claims and in the form of methods of governance."
 aze_relations_between_turks_and_iranians: "Turkic-Iranian Relations"
 aze_relations_between_turks_and_iranians_desc: "Being at the crossroads of various invaders, Iranian land has been home to the Mongols and the Turkic people as well in the past. The Turkic people created the Seljuk Empire some centuries ago, yet their population did not come into steep conflict with Iranian people like how the Arabs did; instead there has been a sort of intermingling of sorts in several areas we call our own today. It is thanks to this intermixing of Turkic and Iranian people in several areas that we can say with confidence that we can and will work with the Turkic communities of our land to keep politics from unfolding in the future."
 aze_fluidity_in_moving_people: "Mass Movements of People"
 aze_fluidity_in_moving_people_desc: "We have seen huge fluctuations in demographics across the whole of our heartland in the past. Places like Isfahan, Herat, and Tabriz have been the host of several different rulers and communities, the latter of which have either moved on to different places or have integrated into these growing urban centers. Perhaps we should look into how and why people engage in these mass movements of sorts and utilize these demographic shifts to shape our state into something more to our liking. It won't be without blood or protests, but it might be a cost we should pay."
 aze_guardians_of_fire: "Guardians of Fire"
 aze_guardians_of_fire_desc: "For what seems like ages we have seen the lands of Iranian people desecrated by invaders and outside forces, but still the memories from olden times live on in the hearts of our people. Through good governance, righteous decisions, a healthy amount of piety, and more than enough military strength, we have and still are proving ourselves to be guardian of the Iranian people. Our muskets and cannons shall be the protectors of the collective fire that burns within all Iranian people, ranging from those in Shirvan and Tabriz to those in Herat and Kabul. It is only through our leadership that we can prevent that fire from ever dying out."

 wes_ary_hajj_ports_and_trade_cities_desc: "In the lands of the Gujarati people, there are several ports with lively urban centers and thriving dockyards that see ships coming and going from across the western waters. These places are important places of trade, yes, but they are also important places for Muslims going on Hajj as they are easy to access comparitvely safe to travel from. Ensuring these 'Hajj Ports' are safe year-round will open them up to not only increased population movement, but also increased trade revenue."
 wes_ary_refined_taxation_and_cultivation: "Lively Cultivation Measures"
 wes_ary_refined_taxation_and_cultivation_desc: "The fertility of Bharat's land is varied as many know if they travel around, but that doesn't stop taxes from flowing and crops from growing. Technology advances ever more in Bharat's land and we should be using this technology to streamline the cultivation of crops, organize the division of labor from area to area and region to region, and refine the taxation practices handed down to us from generations before."
 wes_ary_marathas_mass_of_warriors: "Warriors across Bharat"
 wes_ary_marathas_mass_of_warriors_desc: "Warfare has shaped several parts of Bharat's history in ways similar to how the interactions between religions in its past have come to shape its intellectual stances. Whilst warfare is becoming more oriented to organized armies with gunpowder at the ready, we must never forget the soldier at the bottom of the list: the peasant soldier. In dire times they have been relied on for the defense for various communities and states across Bharat's long history, but today we can shape them into a sizable population ready for recruitment and ready for training."
 wes_ary_regardless_of_your_religion: "Regardless of Religion"
 wes_ary_regardless_of_your_religion_desc: "Philosophy and theology, two subjects intertwined from their roots to their branches in Bharat! An extensive history of religious dialogue is found across the subcontinent stretching all the way back before the times of Satavahana Empire and the Gupta Empire. Whether it has been Jain ascetics interacting with Shaktists, Shaivists interacting with Mahayana Buddhists, or even a Vaishnavist interacting with an Ibadi Muslim, Bharat has and will continue to be a grand home for religious dialogue across several spectrums."
 wes_ary_integrating_the_purbiyas: "Gunpowder Arm of Bharat"
 wes_ary_integrating_the_purbiyas_desc: "The vastness of Bharat's land means there are several autonomous communities that our government has a hard time keeping track of, and it is in these autonomous communities that we find several instances of 'purbiya', mercenary soldiers skilled with gunpowder weapons (and mainly of Rajput origin). Though enforcing more laws on these communities where they live is going to be hard and expensive, we can at the very least work to integrate the purbiyas into Bharat's military as a more elite gunpowder arm to bolster the effectiveness of our armies, albeit at the cost of a little bit of money here and there."
 wes_ary_saurashtri_merchant_ventures: "Mercantile Voyages Westward"
 wes_ary_saurashtri_merchant_ventures_desc: "Since the fall of the Chola Empire centuries ago, these lands of ours have rarely seen extensive mercantile voyages to far off lands in search of opportunity both for trade and for increased political influence. Whilst the latter is certainly harder to achieve for now, the former is looking more and more likely thanks to the safety we project across our coastal cities. Adventuring traders of Saurashtri, Tamil, Tamil, and Bengali heritage are petitioning our administration to charter voyages across the ocean so that they can bolster our trade influence and line their own pockets; why haven't we funded them earlier?"
 wes_ary_honoring_ancestors_of_all: "Honor Every Ancestor"
 wes_ary_honoring_ancestors_of_all_desc: "One facet that Muslim dynasties helped bring to the attention to Hindu, Jains, and Buddhists alike is that of monumental buildings. Truly the places built to honor the dead ancestors of these dynasties are magnificent in their size and beautiful in their details, just like how several temples of Hindu and Buddhist origin are intricately designed and built to honor various deities or key figures. Going forward from here, constructing similarly monumental structures for revered ancestors would go a long way to showing our respect for others in our land, not just our own core people."

 south_supremacy_of_architecture: "Unrivaled Architecture"
 south_supremacy_of_architecture_desc: "All across our land, we can see that there are many buildings that have been erected by people of various times, faiths, and cultures, but what are we to do in light of these accomplishments? Why, we should attempt to build more monuments when and where we can so we can take our place amongst the giants of our past! From temples to statues to palaces, all of Bharat will know just how much effort we put into everything we construct."
 south_rocketry_of_india: "Rockets in Action"
 south_rocketry_of_india_desc: "Gunpowder weapons have been used across our subcontinent for a while, but refining the usage of them into muskets alone has taken quite a while. We struggle sometimes in using these now standard weapons effectively, but with time we will master them both their smaller and larger forms; muskets and rockets alike will become the backbone of Bharat's military. Eventually, if we develop the larger weapons over time, we could be seeing rockets used in pitched battles as well!"
 south_malayali_poetry_in_action: "Blossoming of Poetry"
 south_malayali_poetry_in_action_desc: "The Tamil and Malayali people have a very extensive history of literature in general with poets writing poetry many hundreds of years ago. This appreciation for literature that our ancestors bestowed upon a very sizable portion of our population is strong even to this day, so much so that we would be foolish to let it grow on its own. Building libraries, sponsoring poets, and encouraging education for our general populace so that they too can take part in the rich literary tradition of Bharat is something we are obligated to do."
 south_dialogue_across_religions: "Speak Clearly; Act Softly"
 south_dialogue_across_religions_desc: "Religious divides have struck down several regions before; we have even heard of the turmoil that has gone on inside the Iranian lands to our west ever since the fall of the House of Sasan. Yet, our home subcontinent has been home to a plethora of religious traditions stemming from some common sources, none of which were actively hostile to each other like how sects of Islam or Christianity were to each other. Fostering this attitude of peaceful and insightful religious dialogue will be the driving force for Bharat's theological and philosophical inner peace."
 south_monpolize_subcontinent_trade: "From Cuttack to Ahmedabad"
 south_monpolize_subcontinent_trade_desc: "All across the waters around us, trade ships flow back and forth bringing valuable materials to distant people and ports. We are the center of this crossing since we have several ports along the coast where these oceanic ships dock at to conduct trade. Building up these docks and coastal towns will only grow our advantage even more and attract wealthy merchants from East Africa, Sumatra, and beyond."
 south_rough_terrain_movements: "Paths Across the Subcontinent"
 south_rough_terrain_movements_desc: "A varied landscape, this subcontinent we call home is nothing short of wondrous in terms of the beautiful natural sites all across, but often times these places are hard to traverse for humans and animals alike. Carving out paths through jungles and hills throughout our land so that civilians and military caravans can get through will save time when going from place to place and also bolster the amount of trade that can happen between our various cities."

 south_lets_dance_the_night_away_desc: "Wonderful music, elaborte dances, glorious festivals, and unrivaled blending of cultures together, that is one of the many facets that Bharat brings to the world stage. We work toward a cultural understanding across languages and across religions so that in the future we may live a more harmonious and a more prosperous life; whether it is people practicing Garba or people dancing at the Festival of Colors (otherwise known as Holi), we will bring people together in uplifting celebration."

 hindu_confluence_of_several_matters_desc: "Religious ideas, trade routes, and conquering lords, all three have come through the subcontinent throughout its extensive history. This storied past makes it a central hub for the mixing of various cultures and religions in general, but who are we to say one is inherently more valuable than the other? Though we patronize Hindu traditions the most, we should always be aware of the influence and the value other groups (both religious and cultural) have imbedded within them."

They seem as plentiful in variety as there are colors visible to the human eye, and we of Bharat are keen on seeing them used in their local communities instead of being replaced by one courtly language. Respect for the mother tongue of others is what will grant Bharat a step up in the administration of far flung pieces of land."

Bharat has a mutualistic relationship with most Nepali communities, thankfully, and their defensive posture is exactly what Bharat needs with regards to protecting itself. New fortifications, stronger building materials, and defending at the right points across the land, that is what Nepali advisors focus on for now, and it is what we will listen to for the good of Bharat."
 east_ary_remember_the_in_between_people: "Forgotten, but not for Bharat"
 east_ary_remember_the_in_between_people_desc: "Often times there are so many people caught between major states in history, particularly when it comes to terrain that is harsh and divided with ravines and mountains. Bharat is no stranger to such lands and people, meaning that there are a great number of forgotten people that are still integral to making various districts and states functional. Working to recognize them as a whole, and integrating them within our current administrative framework will yield more cooperative local communities and also a stronger base of loyal citizens."
 east_ary_three_principle_religious_traditions: "Input from the Three Traditions"
 east_ary_three_principle_religious_traditions_desc: "The main three religious traditions that have influenced Bharat so far in its formation are Hinduism, Buddhism, and Islam. There are certainly other, smaller traditions, but these three present the most pertinent groups of interest that we must address going forward as a nation. Instead of promoting one over the other, or trying to play one group off of another, we should be working to facilitate cooperation between the three so that Bharat can focus on other matters in general."
 east_ary_the_respect_of_the_three: "Respect for the Three Traditions"
 east_ary_the_respect_of_the_three_desc: "In working to ensure cooperation between our three main religious traditions, we have learned to respect all three in equal amounts. Through meeting with various imams and emirs, brahmins and pandits, and also monks and ascetics alike, we are growing our knowledge day by day alongside the loyalty of our people. There are rough patches, of course, but we seek to address them in the light of day instead of invoking one religion over another to stifle dissent and unrest."
 east_ary_assimilation_over_time: "Hospitality and Understanding"
 east_ary_assimilation_over_time_desc: "We can learn a lot from seeking out the history of some of the lesser known people of Bharat, and one of those people groups are that of our northeast, where the Ahom Kingdom once lived. Their own history is very much that of rises and falls intermixed with heavy amounts of assimilation of other people groups from the outside as they moved to be near the Bhramaputra River. If we can learn from this, and other histories that we are looking into, and have a focus on assimilation of people that come into the fold of Bharat, then we will undoubtedly have a more righteous reputation with outsiders."
 east_ary_discipline_of_the_himalayas: "Rigor of the Himalayas"
 east_ary_discipline_of_the_himalayas_desc: "Bharat must be protected by a firm military, as every state in this ever-changing world is finding out, yet the training for Bharat's own soldiers are scattered and ill-defined. Promoting more centralized training aimed at the Himalayas (or really any other mountainous region) will help get our soldiers used to harder conditions in general. It might take longer to get suitable soldiers through the process in general since the mountains can be rather deadly at times (which is why we do not use elephants up there), but the end product will be well worth the effort."

 cen_ind_tales_from_ages_past: "Making History by Writing"
 cen_ind_tales_from_ages_past_desc: "There are hundreds if not thousands of tales of lineage and descent across the lands of Bharat, but they are passed down not in the writings of scholars or scribes but instead in the hearts and minds of various royals of both small and large dynasties. Learning about these tales as we thrive and prosper leads only to a stronger understanding of who actually makes up Bharat and what has helped shape it into the very state it is today. Let us chronicle these tales in official texts for future generations, for they deserve to be known by all."
 cen_ind_out_of_the_deep_tropics: "Tropical Upbringing"
 cen_ind_out_of_the_deep_tropics_desc: "Geography has blessed Bharat with plenty of rain and rivers for growth, yet that has also been a menace to some states and people as tropical weather and terrain makes movement and development difficult. But over thousands of years, Bharat's many people groups have carved out livings in the various environments around the subcontinent not least of which is the humid and tropical regions. Taking advantage of these regions will only enhance how Bharat can fight in future wars what with knowledge of rough terrain and environments being inherent in us already."
 cen_ind_nature_will_provide: "Recognition of the Smallest Faiths"
 cen_ind_nature_will_provide_desc: "Hidden within the densest jungles and driest deserts of Bharat, there are communities of people that hold strange beliefs and customs. They contribute to our nation via taxes and production of materials, yes, but the enforcement of various religious laws upon these isolated and hard-to-reach communities has been very hard for many generations even before Bharat became unified. Perhaps it is time we give recognition to these small sects and traditions instead of trying to root them out; they could bring a degree of theological insight that our scholars have yet to come across."
 cen_ind_the_art_of_terrain_movements: "Shift the Ground, Reap Rewards"
 cen_ind_the_art_of_terrain_movements_desc: "Bharat is a nation of the earth, the very earth that gives us plentiful crops, foundations to build upon, and paths for rivers to flow across. It is through the development of villages, cities, and fortifications in various terrain types that has allowed previous states across the subcontinent to flourish, and that knowledge of how to cultivate the land for both economic growth and defensive positions is what is granted to our own nation today."
 cen_ind_fight_to_survive: "The Many Edges of Destruction"
 cen_ind_fight_to_survive_desc: "What is certain about the past eras of the subcontinent is that peace was never destined to last. Whether it was the Gupta Empire fighting against nomadic invaders or the Ghurid invasion along the Ganges River or the Delhi Sultanate conquering southward past Gulbarga, these lands have been the subject of conquest after conquest with Hindu and Muslim states struggling to survive. Our upbringing prior to Bharat was no different, struggling to survive in a maelstrom of various polities vying for dominance across generations. That tenacity, that deep-seated struggle for survival, it still lives within Bharat to this very day."
 cen_ind_infrastructure_leads_to_education: "Literacy in the Deepest Areas"
 cen_ind_infrastructure_leads_to_education_desc: "Whilst we marvel at great cities like Delhi and Cuttack, we have other villages and towns completely shrouded in mystery due to them being so isolated in jungles and forests. Yet, our development of the land has revealed a great many of these previously isolated communities, and our introduction of innovations in city building has led to rising amounts of literacy across the nation. Promoting the building of schools and libraries even in the deepest and most isolated areas of Bharat will serve to strengthen the administration far into the future and bear out new innovations later on."
 cen_ind_without_absolute_authority: "Consultation with Others"
 cen_ind_without_absolute_authority_desc: "Absolute authority in Bharat is an impossibility, dictated by the facts other empires that came before us on the subcontinent knew all too well. Ranging from several different people groups to various religious sects scattered throughout and even just handling the geographic challenges alone for communication, it all makes for a nation that needs to gover by several tiers of administrative processes. Much like how several familial groups in Bharat see the family unit as part of a larger whole, so to will these tiers of administration be part of the larger, all encompassing nation itself."

 wes_ary_secure_the_westward_routes: "Western Trade Routes, Secured"
 wes_ary_secure_the_westward_routes_desc: "Routes to the Arabian Peninsula, Mesopotamia, and East Africa have been plentiful across the western waters, but they have usually been controlled by petty dynasties stemming from Sindh, Gujarat, and the Deccan. Now that we have secured these lands firmly and let trade centers begin to cultivate a prosperous, undisturbed existence, we can begin the recruitment of foreign and domestic talent for the likes of the Hindustani administration."
 wes_ary_irrigation_and_cultivation: "Urban Centers of Hindustani Growth"
 wes_ary_irrigation_and_cultivation_desc: "In places like Delhi, Ujjain, Thatta, Bidar, and Dhaka, cities are growing with such speed that in just a single century, some cities double in population alone. It is staggering how we are able to see such growth in our unified subcontinent, yet we must always be on watch for how we can refine how we develop the infrastructure in these growing cities. Not only this, but looking to how economics change thanks to farmers utilizing new tools and selling to new markets alongside how cities start to change consumption patters will give us new insights into how to manage our own finances."
 wes_ary_deccani_subjugation: "From Maharashtra to Tamilakam"
 wes_ary_deccani_subjugation_desc: "From the lands of the Marathi people to the lands of the Tamil people, the Deccan and Tamilakam itself have been hard to conquer and maintain true control over. Hindustan is a thriving state, yes, but it is one with tension as well as the Deccan is home to various people groups that compete with each other and have their own interests and bases of power. If we can concentrate these people groups toward working in our military through a variety of military developments and projects, then we will be able to not only have a fighting force that is high in quality but also plentiful routes for supplies and movement (civilian and military-wise)."

 #wes_ary_regardless_of_your_religion_desc: #SAME AS THE ONE USED IN BHARAT'S WESTERN ARYAN VERSION##
 wes_ary_rajputs_in_the_military: "Noble and Honored Families, Subservient"
 wes_ary_rajputs_in_the_military_desc: "It is not in question that there are dozens upon dozens of royal families all across Hindustan. Some lead righteous and noble communities, others lead smaller and secluded lives, but all of them have a stake in Hindustan's health, economically and militarily. Whilst we have largely sorted out how they will pay taxes and bring forth goods like dyes, fruits, and manufactured goods to our vast internal market, we have yet to sort out how they will be contributing to our military. Now is the time to do as such, with a strong system of organized ranks and regiments to go along with these still prominent royals."
 wes_ary_build_up_an_ocean_monopoly: "Oceanic Domination"
 wes_ary_build_up_an_ocean_monopoly_desc: "The power of Hindustan is apparent in many places around us, perhaps most of all in the trade routes going by our coasts and sailing across the waters that surround our subcontinent. Extending our reach into these trade routes that are aided by seasonal monsoon weather will only bolster our economy and give us an even better chance at extending Hindustan's influence into places like Sumatra, Java, the Arabian Peninsula, and East Africa."
 wes_ary_gates_to_the_iranian_world: "At Peace with Iranian Influence"
 wes_ary_gates_to_the_iranian_world_desc: "Ghazanvids, Ghurids, Bahmanids, Ilyas Shahi, and more; all of these dynasties that have had (or possibly still do have) considerable influence throughout the lands that Hindustan calls its own now. With each new dynasty and especially with the advent of the Delhi Sultanate's rise and collapse, Iranian culture seeped into the various pockets of the subcontinent. Sufis, emirs, and nawabs alike intermixed and played pivotal roles in introducing this wondrous land to various aspects of Iranian culture, and it is in Hindustan that the cultural blending crystallizes into its greatest form."

 south_lively_culture_and_festivals: "Sing, Dance, and Celebrate!"
 south_lively_culture_and_festivals_desc: "Across Hindustan we see various celebrations and festivals going on every single year, yet some puritanical and zealous members of our faith insist on cracking down on some of these purely Hindu, Jain, and Buddhist events. We are wise enough to turn these demands down as the wondrous music played and the dances performed ensure that the populace is happy and content to some degree. Perhaps our ruler will even join in on occasion, or personally sponsor some of these colorful events."
 south_elephants_and_gunpowder: "New Uses for War Elephants"
 south_elephants_and_gunpowder: "War elephants are by no means unheard of across Hindustan, but the usage of them has been in decline for decades now. Gunpowder weapons are making it so that war elephants are more of a liability than a nearly unstoppable force, but we can change this! If we use our elephants from range with some light artillery pieces, they will be able to effectively support our troops from high up in the field of battle. Plus, the high position allows for a better chance at hitting the enemy instead of firing through our own soldiers just to hit the enemy."
 south_resource_monopolies: "One State to Rule Them All"
 south_resource_monopolies_desc: "Undoubtedly our control over the southern reaches of the subcontinent has garnered us immense profits from taxation alone, but we also must take into account the resources produced too, like various spices and tropical wood. Working with local Malayalam communities will help ensure that our production quotas are always met and that our hegemony over ocean trade is never in jeopardy."
 south_southern_martial_arts: "Promoting Martial Arts"
 south_southern_martial_arts_desc: "Close quarters combat is something well known across the subcontinent, but our main base of power stemming from the southern reaches means that an emphasis on martial arts is certainly present. From the Tamil weapon-based Silambam to the Malayalam Kalaripayattu and more, we will be encouraging the usage of these various combat forms for both recreational purposes and to help harden our military force when they are not on active duty."
 south_tamil_respect_in_both_directions: "Mutualistic Internal Relations"
 south_tamil_respect_in_both_directions_desc: "Tamil people are very influential across Hindustan now that it is a unified state. Coastal cities and lively urban centers often have at least a small and noticeable Tamil population in them, and as they continue to spread out and influence our internal politics, we should do our part and give them respect. Hiring Tamil traders, using Tamil soldiers, and integrating the Tamil language as a whole, it is all part of the active internal cooperation Hindustan strives to foster."
 south_greater_integration_of_all_faiths: "Minority over Hindustan"
 south_greater_integration_of_all_faiths_desc: "Islam is by no means the majority in Hindustan and it never has been. Hinduism and its many traditions combined with Jainism and Buddhism vastly outdo our faith in terms of number of adherents, yet that has not stopped us from unifying the land under one flag and one administration. Learning from this step-by-step experience on conquering and integrating various communities across the subcontinent has made us keenly aware of how we should and should not reconcile differences between faiths on both the large and small scale."
 south_dyes_weaving_and_cloth_making: "Weaving Greater Industries"
 south_dyes_weaving_and_cloth_making_desc: "Hindustan is a grand exporter of dyes, woven clothes, and precious jewels that nobles all across the world would love to have. These outside demands need to be met somehow, or we might be left struggling to compete against our neighbors who are also making leaps to promote their own products on the slowly expanding global market. Investing in new technology that can help our weavers, miners, and farmers get their job done efficiently is exactly what Hindustan needs to secure its place in the globe."

 hindu_raise_up_great_monuments: "Superior Designs of Prestige"
 hindu_raise_up_great_monuments_desc: "From Delhi to Kannauj, and from Chittor to Bidar, monuments are scattered across the subcontinent just waiting to be cultivated even further. Not only this, but new monuments that are both prestigious and functional are waiting to be built by our artisans and engineers. Who are we to stop this march of greatness into the future? And who are we to stop the world from gazing upon our work with amazement?"
 hindu_ganges_river_focus: "Heart of the Ganges River"
 hindu_ganges_river_focus_desc: "Bringing fertility to so many stretches of land across the northern part of our nation, the Ganges River is holy to more than just Hindus alone for good reason. By building up more communities around the river itself, promoting proper irrigation of various fertile lands, and building decent roads beside the river itself, we will ensure a consistent stream of food, taxes, and tradable material."
 hindu_break_down_barriers_between_religions: "Many Minds with Many Truths"
 hindu_break_down_barriers_between_religions_desc: "The northern part of Hindustan (especially from Delhi to Dhaka and Thatta) has been subjected to a myriad of Muslim rulers over the past centuries, yet before then it was a haven to Hindu rulers alongside Buddhist and Jain folks who were widely influential on politics. These seismic shifts in power across the ages has yielded a plethora of outcomes, though we have benefited from the theological and philosophical one mostly. Breaking down the barriers between these religious traditions is perhaps one of the greatest gifts upon Hindustan itself."
 hindu_professional_upcoming_military: "Higher Standards for Hindustan"
 hindu_professional_upcoming_military_desc: "Gunpowder is a good resource for our military to use, but in an unorganized and decentralized military force, gunpowder won't do much of anything. What Hindustan needs is to refine how its weaponry are made, how they are distributed, and most importantly to us going forward, how they are used in battle. It is not going to be easy getting thousands of recruits to know how to handle, clean, reload, and fire a musket properly, but Hindustan will drill them into knowing allof it better than any other military around the world."
 hindu_militant_punjabi_communities: "Rein in Militant Communities"
 hindu_militant_punjabi_communities_desc: "The rise of a centralized military structure and a more adept administration across Hindustan is seen by many as a good thing, but some communities of people wish to retain autonomy in various ways. Instead of cracking down on these communities of people (who can and have fought back against our attempts to rein them in), we should be striving to work with them and making compromises. For example, they can serve in the Hindustani military sector in exchange for increased local autonomy... For now."
 hindu_unparalleled_urban_expansion: "Unrivaled Urban Expansion"
 hindu_unparalleled_urban_expansion_desc: "Our policies regarding taxation, constructing functional buildings inside growing cities, and simply having a degree of peace settle across the landscape has resulted in an unprecedented growth in the size of urban centers. Though this growth is causing tensions with regards to housing and the growth of the merchant class itself, we cannot deny the benefits we have gained so far."
 hindu_northern_and_southern_hindustan: "Logistics of the Subcontinent"
 hindu_northern_and_southern_hindustan_desc: "Getting troops, supplies, money, even animals for farms and markets across the subcontinent has proven to be difficult over the past centuries. Roads are often of varied quality and dirt paths are often the norm instead of gravel or stone roads that are easier for everyone to move across. The time has come for drastic changes if we are to rectify the logistical situation of Hindustan; in the future, we will be able to supply our military and our cities with ample grain and materials thanks to our emphasis on solid road networks."

 east_ary_emphasize_the_bengal_delta: "The World around the Delta"
 east_ary_emphasize_the_bengal_delta_desc: "The Bengal Delta is truly a magnificent gift for the people of Hindustan, both great and small. All of our nation benefits from the trade going on in the Bengal Delta as we do business with merchants from Java, Japan, Arabia, and also East Africa. By reinforcing our focus on the Bengal Delta over time and building more harbors as well as docks to service the incoming merchants from abroad, we will emphasize our position as a true trade hub on the world stage."
 east_ary_lessons_of_nepal: "Lessons in the Mountains"
 east_ary_lessons_of_nepal_desc: "Going through and conquering the various parts of the Himalayas that are inhabited by various Nepali people has been trying to say the least. Attrition and infantry-oriented tactics make for a much different playing field, one that has instilled into Hindustan mindset keen on its infantry as the source of military power, and effective siege equipment to deal with dug in defenders."
 east_ary_the_growth_of_new_religions: "Religious Movements in Hindustan"
 east_ary_the_growth_of_new_religions_desc: "Whilst Hindustan changes throughout its life to face new challenges internally and externally, we must never let our guard down when it comes to the growth of theological challenges too. We are seeing the slow rise of new religious sects and movements in both Hindu and Islamic sectors, but are they truly threats that need military action? The zealous among us say yes, but we are more understanding than they are thanks to our own roots prior to becoming Hindustan; let us speak with these new religious movements and come to terms with them instead of provoking them into conflict."
 east_ary_respect_the_school_of_elders: "The School of Elders, Respected"
 east_ary_respect_the_school_of_elders_desc: "Theravada Buddhism, or, the School of Elders as it is formally known as, is highly influential in certain parts of Hindustan, especially in the east and amongst the Sinhalese people. Though it has several tenets that a mufti or imam of ours would fine strange, the School of Elders shouldn't be shunned in the slightest in Hindustan, for it is this very land we call our home from which the original form of Buddhism arose from and flourished. Respecting the scholars, ascetics, and proponents of Theravada Buddhism will garner us more loyalty amongst citizens and also greater insight into theological issues."
 east_ary_improve_upon_gajapati_organization: "Old Oriya Militarism"
 east_ary_improve_upon_gajapati_organization_desc: "The apex of Oriya power prior to us was that of the Gajapati Empire. A complex and militaristic empire that stretched along the eastern coast, its downfall should not mean Hindustan cannot learn from what happened in its past. The military organization of the Gajapati Empire is one we could actually attempt to improve upon as it had thoroughly defined divisions to work with. If Hindustan can improve upon what was done in the past, it will seem familiar but perform better to those who are used to the old way of things and grant us a greater amount of flexibility militarily."
 east_ary_brahmaputra_and_ganges_authority: "The Ganges and Bhramaputra Rivers"
 east_ary_brahmaputra_and_ganges_authority_desc: "The two main northern rivers by which the Hindustan economy relies upon are the Ganges and the Brahmaputra River, but the Indus River is vital as well despite it only feeding a smaller section of land. What the first two rivers do for us though is undeniable: they feed into the Bengal Delta and provide immense amount of productive potential in the land all along its banks. This means that if we can adapt the usage of various technologies to the wetter conditions of the Bhramaputra as we have done with the Ganges, then we will be an unstoppable economic force on the world stage."
 east_ary_cultural_caste_systems: "Knowing the Many Castes"
 east_ary_cultural_caste_systems_desc: "Throughout Hindustan, there are several versions of what is commonly known to outsiders as the 'caste system'. It is not a 'one size fits all' system when one looks at various communities around the subcontinent with increased focus as certain castes may change in what they do from one region or another, or change in how they are represented from one culture to another. If Hindustan is to sustain a stable administration from the top down, it must look into the castes and not break them down, but rather catalogue and work with them."

 cen_ind_more_than_just_blending_in: "Strictness of Islam, Lifted"
 cen_ind_more_than_just_blending_in_desc: "If one simply takes the Quran and puts it side-by-side next to the Vedas, there is going to be several concepts and ideas in conflict, no? In that same vein, if we were to put the laws dictated by Islam next to the laws dictated by the traditions of the subcontinent and all its diverse people groups, there would be conflicts without end in Hindustan! That is why we have adjusted our laws so heavily to compromise and craft a more stable state, one that cares much less about the actual religion of an advisor or merchant and more so about the inner qualities of the person in question."
 cen_ind_the_good_will_of_sufis: "Sufi Saints of Hindustan"
 cen_ind_the_good_will_of_sufis_desc: "Since our upbringing as a Muslim minority ruling over a Hindu majority, the sufis of our nation have done work in so many fields that we would be a dead state without them. Sponsoring more to come in from the lands of Iran and Arabia will only help Hindustan flourish far into the future, and they will also continue to help bridge the gap between Hindu, Jain, Buddhist, and Muslim communities."
 cen_ind_mastery_of_ruling_through_others: "Networks and Systems of Subjects"
 cen_ind_mastery_of_ruling_through_others_desc: "One perk we have gained from our upbringing is that of knowing just how to rule through other administrators such as viziers, emirs, nawabs, and even rajas. Governing the scattered lands of Hindustan is by no means an easy task for any ruler, but these various advisors and courtiers help see to it that even the communities in the furthest reaches such as those of the Garjat Hills and the Thar Desert are never out of our reach."
 cen_ind_rework_revenue_streams: "Revenue Refinement"
 cen_ind_rework_revenue_streams_desc: "Rebellious sentiment can easily build up in Hindustan if our administration is too relaxed on how it conducts simple things like collecting taxes or conducting trade, which is why we should take the time to carefully examine how we are doing both in with our most rural provincial officials. Refining these parts of our administration especially will help keep rebellious sentiment in check and also keep our revenue in order for the future."
 cen_ind_indirect_expertise: "Learn the Land, Master the Earth"
 cen_ind_indirect_expertise_desc: "Mastering the land itself is something that takes generations to do, but the results of it are immense in every positive sense of the word. Our fortifications will tower over the land yet be positioned in such a way that they make the enemy suffer much more during long sieges. Our cities as well will eventually be ordered in such a way that civilians and military personnel are able to move through with ease thanks to paved roads, proper drainage, and well taken care of logistics."
 cen_ind_firearms_of_the_tropics: "Weather Adapted Weapons"
 cen_ind_firearms_of_the_tropics_desc: "One thing that has plagued gunpowder weapons in Hindustan for generations now is the humidity and the rain; they just won't work if things are too wet! That is why our engineers have been out in the tropical areas where the Gondi and Jharkhandi people live, testing new devices and designs that mitigate this problem somewhat. These new firearms are not the greatest and perhaps only have limited usage in certain wet conditions, but they will give an advantage if we distribute them properly and train enough troops with them."
 cen_ind_pragmatism_over_zealotry: "Pragamtic Administrators"
 cen_ind_pragmatism_over_zealotry_desc: "If there is one word that sums up how Hindustan handles much of its politics, it is this: pragmatism. Handling so many things in a realistic sense rather than a perhaps religious or militaristic sense has granted Hindustan many perks and favors over the years, and it is because of this pragmatic attitude that we are able to do without things like building restrictions on certain religious communities or militarization of certain areas that are better suited for other purposes. We are a sensible nation, looking to do sensible things internally with our own people."

 #Orleans Ideas#
 one_of_the_richest_french_cities: "Three Key Cities of France"
 one_of_the_richest_french_cities_desc: "The Loire River provides France with immense amounts of water, yes, but it also provides France with immense amounts of dangerous river crossings. The bridges required to cross the Loire River are not plentiful and because of this, only a few cities across France have been able to propser besides the Loire River. Paris and Rouen have been the other two key cities that have been instrumental in French economic growth as of late, yet Orleans is certainly not counted out of this set of cities, not when business is looking up."
 she_made_us_famous: "Joan of Arc"
 she_made_us_famous_desc: "8th of May, 1429, that was the fateful day where Joan of Arc (with the help of royal generals Dunois and Florent d'Illers) was able to enter the city to help lift the siege from the Plantagenets during the prolonged Hundred Years' War. Her efforts and her memory last on in Orleans to this very day and veneration of her is not uncommon throughout the city and its rural areas. We would be foolish to let this memory go to waste when teaching and training the soldiers of Orleans, no, we should use her example to invigorate the commanders and soldiers alike!"
 exports_of_saffron_from_orleans: "Agriculture in Orleans on the Rise"
 exports_of_saffron_from_orleans_desc: "The Hundred Years' War took a great toll on the economies of both England and France as the prolonged warfare meant that levies and taxes had to be taken from peasants and nobility across multiple decades for little return. Orleans was affected by this as well, unfortunately, but the rebound we are experiencing now is something we should be focused on! Farming is on the rise, structures in the city center are coming together, and most importantly, saffron is being grown once more. Such a delectable spice being resurgent in Orleans is sure to attract hungry merchants from across Europe!"
 chatelains_of_orleans_know_fashion: "Chatelains, Keepers of Style"
 chatelains_of_orleans_know_fashion_desc: "The chatelains (castle keepers) of Orleans are snobbish and stuck-up a lot of the time, but there are instances where that arrogant nature benefits us as a whole. They were eccentric and unique clothing styles compared to other chatelains throughout French lands and they can often times be found idly chatting about the latest trends in what other nobles and royals are wearing. It may be a meaningless subject to peasants or soldiers, but to courtiers and royalty, being of high prestige and uniquely good appearance helps make for good relations."
 invigoration_in_our_university: "Philisophy and Theology in Orleans"
 invigoration_in_our_university_desc: "Established with the oversight of Pope Clement V in 1306, the University of Orleans has been a central facet of our growth as a city and more recently, as a state within French lands vying for power and influence. Though the Catholic Church may look down on us for hosting theological and philosophical debates regarding a myriad of topics, we will not stand in the way of progress when it comes to exploring new ideas. The university is where these ideas will be tested with rigor so that only the best ones are used in the administration of Orleans."
 hoc_venant_lilla_corde: "'Hoc Vernant Lilla Corde'"
 hoc_venant_lilla_corde_desc: "'It is by this heart that lillies flourish'. Such a motto is slowly becoming what many advisors and courtiers say about Orleans as a whole. Increasingly we are seen as an integral part of the idea of 'France' on a political map and as a concept to strive; if claimants to the French throne do not have influence or ties with Orleans, they are likely to be on unstable ground if and when they ascend to the throne itself. We should use this amount of influence we have wisely, for every step we take in diplomacy and politics is noted by royals not just in French lands, but in English, German, Italian, and even Iberian lands."

These attempts at gaining power do include raiding and intruding on what is rightfully territory of the Ming Dynasty, meaning that we have had to double up our fortification efforts along the Great Wall. Not only this, but the encounters with cavalry-based militaries of the Yuan pretenders has also taught a great portion of our military how to deal with their tactics, thereby granting us an edge against them in future conflicts."

 joint_administration_on_the_frontier_desc: "Minorities living at the edges of our realm are something we must always be aware of; if they are mistreated or abused by local magistrates and governors, then they can easily foment unrest in hard-to-reach areas and cause great deal of strife later on. We should work to have two standards in place since our core populace of Han Chinese are often times living with or nearby these minority communities: one set of standards for those of Han Chinese classification, and another set of standards for those of non-Han Chinese classification (with further sub-divisions of laws for various minorities given the exact region/area)."
 commissioning_of_texts: "Commission New Texts"
 commissioning_of_texts_desc: "The Red Turban Rebellion set in motion the transition from one dynasty to another, that much is clear to all by now, but what wasn't clear to us just after the rebellion was what would happen to the literary tradition and legacy we have before us. Now that things have stabilized and the Ming Dynasty has solidified its place in the world, we can work on commissioning new texts around philosophy, metaphysics, administration, astronomy, agriculture, mathematics, and more. The texts will undoubtedly serve to promote our wealth and grandeur whilst also spreading innovative ideas around our realm."
 contending_with_piracy_in_the_east: "Proper Naval Measures"
 contending_with_piracy_in_the_east_desc: "The lucrative trade alongside our coast makes for a wide open and vast target for piracy which has historically been an issue previous dynasties had to deal with. We are no different in this sense and must work toward outfitting our ships with better fierarms, robust designs, and coastal fortifications that can support our fleets when they need it."
 dealing_with_multi_ethnic_and_corrupt_armies: "Varied Troops with Corruption"
 dealing_with_multi_ethnic_and_corrupt_armies_desc: "It is not secret that in the lands of the Ming Dynasty, being in the military is looked down upon by the rest of society. It isn't prestigious nor noble like some foreigners would normally think since most soldiers are illiterate and not under the command of civil officials, leading to immense corruption at times; this can be further amplified by the multi-ethnic status of our military. What we must do is work toward educating parts of the military and in essence giving it a slightly higher place in society. A healthy dose of civil authority and measures to shed some light on this shady sector of the Ming Dynasty will go a long way to improving the overall quality."
 our_art_surpasses_the_song_and_yuan: "Evolving Artistic Styles"
 our_art_surpasses_the_song_and_yuan_desc: "The Song Dynasty and the Yuan Dynasty had their respective zeniths with regards to artistry and much of it is still exemplified today, but the question remains as to how will we impact this legacy of artistic endeavors. Whether we patronize sculpting, monument builders, or perhaps even portrait painters, we will take up the artistic legacy left to us and usher in a new cultural flourishing that will make neighboring tributaries lust like never before."
 toward_the_three_divisions_and_beyond: "Innovating from Weisuo"
 toward_the_three_divisions_and_beyond_desc: "The Hongwu Emperor set up for us the 'weisuo' system of military organization which was similar to the 'fubing' system of the Tang Dynasty, but we are realizing more and more that it is becoming outdated. Firearms both big and small are making it so that new military divisions are overtaking the old ones, so much so that the new three core divisions are becoming too integral to do without; these three divisions are: Shenjiying (Firearms Division), Wujunying (Five Barracks Battallion), and Sanqianying (Three Thousand Batallion). Transitioning to these divisions fully will take time, but it will ensure that the Ming Dynasty is ready to innovate on its own military for the future."

#Nagpur Ideas#
 lessons_on_understanding_differences: "Coming to Know Every Community"
 lessons_on_understanding_differences_desc: "We know the Gondi, Garjati, and Jharkhandi people very well, but those outside of our cultural sphere are seen as strange or foreign throughout the heart of Nagpur. In our expansion outward, we will put forth programs and policies to help integrate these foreign people coming into Nagpur. Their culture will be respected, their language will be known, and their customs will be seen as integral to all of Nagpur over time, even if it takes a few generations to do so."
 regarldess_of_religion_you_work: "Communal Work Ethic"
 regarldess_of_religion_you_work_desc: "Even our own practices that are regarded as Hindu in nature is seen as strange by those of Shaivism, Shaktism, and Vaishnavism. Often times our own people have integrated Hindu, Buddhist, or even sometiems Islamic customs into local followings and traditions, meaning that our core set of people know exactly how to deal with outside religious differences. In overcoming these religious differences, Nagpur can and will see a stronger push for a communal work ethic that can bring about great works within towns and cities."
 raiding_through_swift_cavalry: "Swift Raids of Nagpur"
 raiding_through_swift_cavalry_desc: "The location of Nagpur being in the heart of the subcontinent means that prolonged sieges and pitched battles have been less common throughout its history. Instead what we see skirmishes and sieges shorter in length alongside the raiding of villages and towns for resources; at times, successful raids could even turn into conquests. We of Nagpur carry forth this tradition into the future as we focus more on mobility for raiding and striking at the enemy when they least expect it; if these tactics also yield bountiful plunder for our treasury, that is merely icing on the cake."
 welcome_the_maratha_warriors_inside: "Integration of Maratha Families"
 welcome_the_maratha_warriors_inside_desc: "The Marathas are ambitious in their own right as they have struggled under the leadership of various rajas and sultans alike, but we should not succumb to the pressure they put on Nagpur as a whole. Integrating them into our military and our warrior caste will bolster Nagpur's reputation with the large Maratha population throughout the Deccan whilst also emboldening others who look up the Maratha warriors to pledge fealty to the Nagpur military."
 heart_of_subcontinental_conflict: "In the Firey Heart"
 heart_of_subcontinental_conflict_desc: "The land which we call home has seen conquest after conquest by various rulers and dynasties. From the Satavahana Dynasty to the Rashtrakuta Dynasty, and from the Kalachuris of Mahishmati to the Delhi Sultanate, our very existence is within the heat of the furnace that is this subcontinent. Picking up our weapons to defend our own borders and to settle old feuds is nothing new to any family in Nagpur, so let us formalize this militant attitude of ours with officers and soldiers that can go toe-to-toe with any enemy."
 aiding_and_striking_rebels_down: "Land of Shades and Secrets"
 aiding_and_striking_rebels_down_desc: "Within our heartland are hidden paths and barely charted villages that hide out in the tropical areas where movement is tough and conducting battle is even worse. It is in these parts of Nagpur that political exiles have kept themselves at times so that they can wait for the right time to return to their own land, but what if we could use them for our own purposes? And what if we could actually garner knowledge on these remote communities within our own borders? Such information would mean that striking down our own political exiles and rebel leaders would be much easier."
 monsoon_knowledge_and_regularity: "Aged by the Monsoons"
 monsoon_knowledge_and_regularity_desc: "The weather of Nagpur is very seasonal what with the rainy season producing any number of results for our people depending on how much comes down. It is this consistent monsoon cycle that we need to catalogue, predict, and learn to work with so that the goods of Nagpur are not compromised by unprepared workers and families. The more time we invest into this matter, the better off we will be in the future when new technologies change how we cultivate certain crops like cotton and fruits."

#Lan Xang Ideas#
 the_terror_inside_lan_xang_for_12_years: "12 Years of Anarchy"
 the_terror_inside_lan_xang_for_12_years_desc: "From about 1428 to 1440 there was almost no internal cohesion within Lan Xang. The death of Lan Kham Daeng ushered in a period of strife so great that few nobles and monks could tell who was actually the ruler of Lan Xang; even Vientiane revolted against the fractured administration. Thankfully we have stamped out the flames of anarchy from back then and are well on our way to establishing Lan Xang's dominance across all internal domains. The next time regicide and revolt are threatened against Lan Xang, we will be far more prepared."
 mandala_established_by_fa_ngum: "Reinforce the Mandala of Lan Xang"
 mandala_established_by_fa_ngum_desc: "The concept of the mandala on a political level is much older than Lan Xang itself, though that does not mean that Lan Xang should be subjected to its rules at every single point. There are times where we will need to enforce our mandala over the others surrounding Lan Xang and assert proper authority over places ruled by Vietnamese, Khmer, Thai, and even Burmese people alike. If we can get these various people groups around us to recognize the central mandala established by Fa Ngum in 1357, they will be all the more willing to serve us through tribute and service."
 sacred_is_the_phra_bang: "Sacred is the Phra Bang"
 sacred_is_the_phra_bang_desc: "Our palladium, our grandiose image of grandeur and legitimacy that is greatly revered across most of the heart of Lan Xang is called the Phra Bang. It's symbolism is not lost on any peasant, monk, or noble of our land that sees it, for it has been with us since the inception of Lan Xang itself by Fa Ngum. With it safely in Luang Prabang, it is seen as a sign generally as the right to rule over Lan Xang as only a venerable and virtuous ruler and their administration may be the caretaker of such a sacred image. So long as Luang Prabang and its inner areas are safe from harm, Phra Bang is assured safety and so are we."
 translate_the_classics_into_lao: "Buddhist Classics, Translated"
 translate_the_classics_into_lao_desc: "with our growing power and influence, the rise in the number of people that can read and write is certainly being felt all across Lan Xang. Lao people from lower classes are picking up manuscripts and attempting to read them whilst those fortunate enough to have the capability are trying to integrate writing into their daily lives. It is here that we can improve on the religious foundation of Lan Xang by translating the old Buddhist texts like the Tripitaka from Sanskrit or Pali into Lao. In doing this, we will be seen as publicly encouraging literacy and intrigue into new and old ideas alike."
 master_the_mekong_river: "Masters of the Mekong River"
 master_the_mekong_river_desc: "Through the heart of Lan Xang is the mighty Mekong River, a bountiful though dangerous asset to have for any state wishing to wrest control over the region. Much like the Khmer to our south, we are in the midst of learning how to properly master the Mekong's various crossing points and seasonal shifts. If we can do as such and ready ourselves for when heavy rain is coming or for swift movements where the river is calm enough, we will be one step ahead of our enemies in terms of mobility and defense."
 muang_and_vieng_classifications: "Muangs and Viengs"
 muang_and_vieng_classifications_desc: "The classification of 'muang' and 'vieng' are not set in stone, but they are generally seen as meaning major cities, towns, or settlements with fortified walls. Defining these terms more clearly and putting our resources into building up walled settlements that can withstand both enemy sieges and natural weather will mean that we can rely on a strong defense whilst our offense is getting ready."
 blended_buddhism_within_lan_xang: "Old Traditions Never Die"
 blended_buddhism_within_lan_xang_desc: "Despite the heavy presence of Theravada Buddhism throughout Lan Xang, old beliefs persist throughout the hills and highlands where communities are more isolated in general. We should not try to openly convert these communities in the hills as they can easily become unreachable havens of rebel sentiment. Working with them and respecting their beliefs is a much more harmonious way of approaching the situation as even though they still practice old beliefs that are not Buddhist in nature, they do integrate several Buddhist traditions alongside their own."

#Dai Viet Ideas#
 from_ruler_to_favorite_son: "From Ruler to Favorite Son"
 from_ruler_to_favorite_son_desc: "It is a practice dating all the way back in the Tran Dynasty (1225-1400) and continued into the era of Dai Ngu (1400-1407), bequeathing the throne to a designated son is what is normal within Dai Viet. We do not let petty sons fight over the throne with various armies assembled across the state for that only leads to horrible civil wars. Instead we will continue the practice of knowing which child is ordered to succeed the throne so as to instill a greater sense of legitimacy at court and amongst landed elites."
 satisfy_ming_pride_whilst_being_independent: "Orderly Tributary Status"
 satisfy_ming_pride_whilst_being_independent_desc: "Coming out of the Fourth Chinese Domination of our lands (1407-1427), Le Loi established a formal tributary relationship between Dai Viet and the Ming Dynasty. Things may have changed since this time as politics in the Ming Dynasty change just as much as they do within Dai Viet, but we are keen on being seen as a reputable and trustworthy diplomatic partner in this regard. Whether it's being a faithful subject or a benevolent overlord to other tributaries, we of Dai Viet know what a master-apprentice or a liege-subject relationship entails; let us never dishonor such relationships without proper reasoning."
 engineering_of_ho_nguyen_trung: "Engineering Inside Dai Viet"
 engineering_of_ho_nguyen_trung_desc: "We have a recent legacy with firearms both big and small and part of it comes from the likes of Ho Nguyen Trung (born in 1374). He attempted to defend Dai Ngu from the Ming Dynasty in the past and contributed to the manufacture of early 'eruptor cannons' as well as other firearms within our own lands. Despite him living out the rest of his life in exile in service of the Ming Dynasty, the legacy of firearms especially with regards to siege-oriented ones is something we will always try to live up to."
 grounded_neo_confucian_outlook: "Grounded within Confucianism"
 grounded_neo_confucian_outlook_desc: "Whilst we have a very long history with Buddhism as well as various other influences from old beliefs and even Hindu-oriented traditions, Confucian influences stream into Dai Viet from the north at a constant rate. It's becoming more and more prominent in Dai Viet as time goes on and we are seeing the fruits of this come about in our administration. Less Buddhist temples (like pagodas) are being built and fewer pieces of land are being granted to Buddhists in general, whereas we are seeing a stronger emphasis on education through helping people learn to read and write before studying regular subjects like mathematics or geography."
 foreigners_are_beneath_dai_viet: "Shun the Foreigners"
 foreigners_are_beneath_dai_viet_desc: "Though we are not immune to foreigners, we do hold them as distinctly secondary to those at the heart of Dai Viet: the Vietnamese people themselves. Whether they are Lao, Chinese, Cham, Khmer, or some other foreign culture altogether, the Vietnamese people and their way of conducting both religious and political matters will be enshrined as unique and above others. Though we may have some traits like those surrounding us, we will never be exactly like them and neither can they be exactly like us."
 the_arts_of_dai_viet_flourish: "Artistic Explorations"
 the_arts_of_dai_viet_flourish_desc: "After being freed from the Chinese in 1427, the spark of artistic exploration was slow in how it came back to life. Thankfully though, it is due to our policies and efforts on all fronts that our own people are once more reaching out into the artistic world to explore what they can do once again. Artistic forms like hat tuong (a form of Vietnamese opera), cheo (a form of satirical musical theatre), and ca tru (a form of musical storytelling done by a female vocalist) are all being attempted and refined in more than just a few towns and cities. This development of our culture over time is something to be celebrated; it separates us from the rest of the surrounding states and puts us on our own shining pedestal."
 expansion_of_the_confucian_examinations: "Testing is now in Session"
 expansion_of_the_confucian_examinations_desc: "Late 1426 saw a small Confucian examiniation held in Dong Kinh by Le Loi. Though small in scope, it set a precedent going forward to continue having Confucian-like examiniations so that the administration of Dai Viet could have a strong set of educated officials to work with. As we grow as a state with more aspects to worry about, we will need to expand these examinations over time to encompass more towns and more provinces. Thus, the more educated officials at the disposal of Dai Viet, the better off the state will be with regards to it's functions in every respect."

#Khmer Ideas#
 at_our_very_end_we_still_fight: "Pushed to the Edge"
 at_our_very_end_we_still_fight_desc: "Time and time again our state has been pushed back by revolts, invasions, internal strife, and even natural disasters that stormed across our land. The worst of it was perhaps the Fall of Angkor in 1431 wherein Ponhea Yat fled and had to establish a new capital at Phnom Penh. In these bloody and sorrowful memories of our past, there is a solid notion that we should take to heart: Khmer people and those of the state itself will never give in to the enemy no matter how bad it gets. Our glorious capital may fall into ruins, but the spirit and people will always live on."
 we_are_no_devarajas: "Lack of Divine Blood"
 we_are_no_devarajas_desc: "Though Hinduism has had a very long history in these lands of ours, it is clear that traditional Hindu notions of society and authority are no longer what is right for Khmer. Our past rulers recognized this after the transition from Hinduism to Buddhism in the middle of the 1300s and with that transition came the fall of the idea that our ruler was a god-king, or, a devaraja. In doing this, our rulers are more human than some others around us; they can relate to the common people more so and are more humble than surrounding rulers most of the time. In continuing this more human view of the ruler, we will ensure a more concrete connection to the Khmer people."
 retake_the_river_trade: "The Issue of Mekong River Trade"
 retake_the_river_trade_desc: "The decline of our state has led to the rise of Lan Xang in the north and the growth of Thai power in the west, though the former is what threatens our heartland most in terms of monetary value. The Lao of Lan Xang actively attempt to hinder our trade efforts downstream through incursions and backroom deals, yet we still control the southern part of the Mekong River which is most vital. If we can continue to capitalize on our core region of the Mekon River and promote growth around it via markets and safe villages, we will be able to claw back what power was taken from us by Lan Xang."
 lacking_in_firearms_but_not_elephants: "Warfare in the Wetlands"
 lacking_in_firearms_but_not_elephants_desc: "The humid air of the region makes for less than ideal travel conditions, let alone conditions for using firearms. Though there are periods of time when it is dry enough to use firearms, we know that these are few and far between when compared to places like the Indian Subcontinent or mainland China. Thus the armies of Khmer and other nearby states still rely on elephants to do much of the heavy lifting and cavalry charges, and we are more than ready to continue to use massive elephant charges against our foes in any region."
 the_thai_khmer_rivalry: "The Rivalry Continues"
 the_thai_khmer_rivalry_desc: "We will never forget what the Thai have done to us in their destruction of our power and our formerly glorious capital at Angkor. Despite our losses and setbacks time and time again, we can still fight and make things right once more by retaking what belongs to us and putting all surrounding people groups in their proper place: subservient to Khmer. Let this fire that burns in us to bring justice for past transgressions never die out!"
 rekindle_those_long_lost_trade_ties: "Lost Trade Ties, Renewed"
 rekindle_those_long_lost_trade_ties_desc: "Previous centuries saw our glorious state connected to old states in the south like Srivijaya and Majapahit, but just as those states decayed into fractured realms fighting for old titles and glory, so to did our realm. Once we regain our footing and are able to assert military and economic dominance in our own lands, we should look to rekindle the trade ties in the south that we valued so much in the past."
 concentrated_effort_to_rebound: "Back from the Brink!"
 concentrated_effort_to_rebound_desc: "There is no doubt in the mind of any ruler from Lan Xang, Dai Viet, Sukhothai, or Ayutthaya that the lands we hold are very valuable with regards to fertility, strategy, and diplomacy, but to hold it down would mean dismantling most parts of the state we are culivating at this very moment. They could not do it before and they will not do it anytime soon as we are growing stronger than ever before thanks to our recent efforts. It has been a long and tumultuous road so far, but it was all worth it in the end as we are seeing the fruits of that labor come about day by day, month by month, and year by year."

#Oman Ideas#
 temporal_spiritual_imam_authority: "The Imams of Oman"
 temporal_spiritual_imam_authority_desc: "Ibadi Islam has a fiery history that dates all the way back to the Muhakkima, one of the supporters  of Ali in the First Fitna (though they later revoked this support). Ibn Ibad's teachings that were developed later by Jabir ibn Zayd helped form the theological basis by which the first Ibadi state would be established in Hadhramaut, but after it failed during the Umayyad Caliphate, Ibadi teachings settled in Oman in the mid to late 700s. Part of the basis for Ibadi Islam that is quite different from other branches is that the imam that leads the people (and has control over spiritual and temporal matters) is to be elected, not divinely chosen. Granted this is not easy to do for Oman today, we do try to stick to the initial and guiding teachings of Ibadi Islam."
 contesting_south_arabian_trade: "South Arabian Shootouts"
 contesting_south_arabian_trade_desc: "There are very valuable trade ports that have been utilized for centuries across the southern portion of the Arabian Peninsula. There are a few key trade goods found here that valued by various people ranging from Catholics to Hindus and many others, meaning they must come to either us or any number of other polities on the coast for business. What this also means is that we need look toward cutting down the other polities on the coast leading down to Yemen so that they do not infringe on our trade deals. Let the musket fire ring out across the deserts!"
 azd_nabhani_hinawi_ghafiri_tribes: "Maintain Omani Authority"
 azd_nabhani_hinawi_ghafiri_tribes_desc: "There are a great deal of tribal connections throughout Oman, let alone the entirety of the Arabian Peninsula. From the Azd to the Nabhani, and from the Hinwai to the Ghafiri, these tribes seek political authority and autonomy within Oman as time goes by, but we need to make sure their demands do not throw the state into chaos. Maintaining a firm grip on power through diplomacy and military force if need be is what is going to keep Omani lands safe and sound."
 defending_muscat: "Through Muscat, Oman Lives"
 defending_muscat_desc: "For centuries Muscat has been known as a valuable trade port and it has attracted both mercantile and political attention from beyond the Arabian Peninsula on multiple occasions. Whilst we have arid lands to help us stave off invasions across land, we do need to work toward building up a more potent fleet of ships to defend Muscat as well as all the coastal territories Oman claims. Muskets, cannons, and new ship designs will all help us reach this goal of an powerful yet efficient Omani trade fleet."
 with_agriculture_comes_naval_pwoer: "Invest into Coastal Villages"
 with_agriculture_comes_naval_pwoer_desc: "We can't help but focus on the coastal dwellings of Oman since beyond them lies the arid desert sands; they don't provide much for us as of right now. If we can invest money toward agricultural and infrastructure opportunities (like qanats for usable fresh water) in coastal communities though, we are likely to see a distinct rise in both our population and our capabilitiy to exert power elsewhere."
 arabian_and_african_ports: "Living on the Coasts"
 arabian_and_african_ports_desc: "It isn't just in South Arabia that people seek coastal communities for more opportunity and stability. Places such as Mogadishu, Zanzibar, Bahrain, Aden, and several others have this trend that Oman has experienced as well over several generations, meaning that they are all ripe for being apart of a more connected oceanic trade network. As of now many of the significant costal towns are outside of Oman's grasp, but our merchants and ships will arrive soon enough for both business and diplomacy."
 troops_and_ships_hand_in_hand: "Together as One!"
 troops_and_ships_hand_in_hand_desc: "Extending Oman's influence to all these coastal towns and villages means there needs to be a military and navy to back it all up. Whilst our ships and sailors have been our pride and joy for generations now, we should start to include a more formalized military to go along with the Omani navy. If both the coming military and the current navy can efficiently work together as a single unit, keeping control of our extensive state will be much easier."

#Hejaz and Medina Ideas#
 sacred_are_the_two_cities: "The Two Hearts of Islam"
 sacred_are_the_two_cities_desc: "Mecca and Medina, the two places by which all Muslims far and wide must attempt to make a pilgrimage to at some point in their life if possible. Though the external politics of the Arabian Peninsula are constantly shifting around us, we sharifs of Mecca and protectors of Medina will continue to guard the cities for the faithful Muslims across the world. It is a duty that is pious in nature, prestigious to others, and at times bloody in what must be done."
 between_sunni_and_shiites: "Religious Power Shifts"
 between_sunni_and_shiites_desc: "The history of these two holy cities of ours has not always been stable since religious conflict between sects of Islam arose after the Four Rightly Guided Caliphs passed on. Part of these conflicts were between Sunni Muslims and Shiite Muslims wherein for a time, the Sulayhids of Yemen controlled Mecca and appointed Shiite emirs to rule the holy city. Though this time period of religious struggles around Mecca and Medina is mostly over, we must still remember to welcome Muslims from every sect into these holy cities not just for taxation, but also to continue to be recognized as a pious leader by all Muslims."
 cooperation_with_outside_authorities: "Cooperation for Prosperity"
 cooperation_with_outside_authorities_desc: "Guardians of Mecca and Medina are we, though we have been subjected to the whims of outside powers too such as the Sulayhids of Yemen, the Ayyubids of Egypt, and Mamluk Sultanate as well. In being the subject of various powers, the families that watch over Mecca and Medina know very well how to work with foreign powers so as to maintain peace across the Hejaz area. Religious affiliations aside, the great many external powers that hail us as sharifs know that it would be unwise to try to uproot and replace what we have cultivated for centuries now."
 from_hasan_ibn_ali_are_we: "Descendants of Hasan ibn Ali"
 from_hasan_ibn_ali_are_we_desc: "To be qualified as a sharif in the first place, you must be a descendant in some way of Hasan ibn Ali, the grandson of the prophet Muhammad himself. In having this sanctified blood running through the veins of our rulers, there is very little doubt that we should and will continue to be the custodians of these two holy cities. Mecca and Medina are in a sense outside of the normal political shifts that occur in places like Mosul, Basra, Muscat, or Tehran; these cities must be preserved by those of a sayyid lineage (meaning they must be actual descendants of the prophet Muhammad)."
 money_from_pilgrims: "Steady Money from Pilgrims"
 money_from_pilgrims_desc: "It isn't easy funding every part of our state with just the usual taxation from land owners and such; the land of Hedjaz is arid and trade along the Red Sea brings in only so much money. That is why taxes on faithful pilgrims coming to make fulfill their holy duty by undertaking the Hajj will help ensure that we do not run out of money in the future. It isn't just for lavish projects and such, as the pilgrims should already know; we do employ a military that needs to defend these lands from raiders and brigands seeking to extort innocent villages and travelers."
 strides_into_political_matters: "Cross the Political Barriers"
 strides_into_political_matters_desc: "Traditionally we have been reluctant to get involved in political matters outside of the Arabian Peninsula what with the Ayyubids, Fatimids, Seljuks, and even the Mamluks dealing with matters that don't really impact those of the Hejaz area. The Mamluks started to do things differently, however, and they began to involve us more and more into politics outside of our traditional home territory, meaning we are coming into contact with a great deal of foreign states our ancestors could only dream of. As both positive and negative attention comes toward the Hejaz area, we must seek out more determined defenders of the holy cities, those driven to keep unwanted invaders from encroaching into our lands as our influence slowly begins to spread."
 potential_for_caliphate_status: "Caliphate Ambitions"
 potential_for_caliphate_status_desc: "In the time of Abu'l-Futuh al-Hasan ibn Ja'far (994-1038), he was proclaimed (counter-)caliph with the help of a former Fatimid vizier to oppose the Fatimid Caliphate. It did not last long as the support beneath the would-be caliph ran out in the very same year he was proclaimed, but these memories remain strong within our state to this very day. We are of sayyid blood as it is and the old Fatimid Caliphate is long gone alongside the Abbasid Caliphate, meaning the position is effectively vacant for now. Should we garner enough power, prestige, and territory to assert both religious and political authority across more than just the Arabian Peninsula, we might just be able to claim the title of 'caliphate' once and for all."

 making_do_with_what_we_have_desc: "What remains of our once glorious empire... Fragments all scattered throughout like a foundation in tatters. Yet, all is not lost! These scattered places of Byzantine strength working as bastions of our prowess and prestige are still capable hubs for attracting ferocious mercenaries and docking our ships. If we are to rebuild back to what we once were, we are going to need to rely on both mercenaries and our navy alike."
 stopping_the_supply_shortages: "Robust Logistical Oversight"
 stopping_the_supply_shortages_desc: "In previous skirmishes and battles that saw our eventual decay before the rising Ottoman Empire, logistics were a key issue that our military faced. In trying to address our military pitfalls, organizing supply lines to moving armies as well as just how supplies are brought to our defensive fortifications will greatly improve the quality of our armies over time."
 from_an_economic_abyss: "Economic Abyss No More"
 from_an_economic_abyss_desc: "As one might expect, a decaying empire losing ground to stronger and stronger enemies is going to see economic turmoil wash over it. We have already been through such turmoil unfortunately, but now that we have the lessons of the past with us and experience going through such economic woes, we can improve our finances through taxes and trade to better reflect our empire's actual glory."
 militant_like_the_komnenos: "Militant like the Komnenoi"
 militant_like_the_komnenos_desc: "Though long gone now, the age of the Komnenoi saw a massive overhaul of the army of Byzantium. The traditional composition was done away with due to massive losses at Manzikert and Dyrrachion and instead a new army was composed made of more disciplined and professional contingents like the vestiaritai, the vardariotai, and the archontopouloi. Looking back to this time of restructuring in the military gives us not only a solid foundation to look back upon but also an example to replicate through various means; it won't be easy to build up a disciplined and professional military once again, but it will be worth it!"
 learning_from_the_angeloi: "Learn from the Angeloi"
 learning_from_the_angeloi_desc: "The reign of the Angeloi was... Turbulent, to say the least. Under the reign of Isaac II, Alexios III, Alexios IV, and Alexios V, the entire realm was consumed by fires both internally and externally which led to the formation of the Latin Empire and the Empire of Nicaea alongside other petty states. Though we are whole once again thanks to the righteous efforts of the Michael VIII, we must still thoroughly scour the archives and learn as much as we can from the era of the Angeloi."
 glorious_like_the_palaiologos: "Glory be to the Palaiologoi"
 glorious_like_the_palaiologos_desc: "Despite the issues of the Ottoman Empire pressing against us at all points throughout their rise to power, we refuse to give in to their demands for land, wealth, and influence! The Palaiologoi are not just meant for restoring the empire through recapturing Constantinople and some other scattered lands, no, they are meant for much greater things! Through staunch efforts from every part of Byzantium, we will rise to glory and strive for a righteous retaking of what is rightfully ours. It can thus be said that the 'Palaiologos Restoration' is well and truly upon us."
 pieces_of_the_purple_puzzle: "Pieces of the Purple Puzzle"
 pieces_of_the_purple_puzzle_desc: "And as we continue our resistance to the Muslims and Catholics from both sides, we will retake what was once graced by the imperial touch of the Roman Empire itself. Macedonia, Anatolia, the Levant, and so many other places that were once under the auspices of the basileus will again feel the renewed vigor of a robust administration stemming from Constantinople. The road ahead will be filled with bloodshed, sweat, tears, and heartbreak on all sides, but for rebirth to happen, sacrifices must be made."

#Poland Ideas
 folwarks_through_and_through: "The Folwark System"
 folwarks_through_and_through_desc: "A nobleman's landholding in the Commonwealth is usually comprised of what we call a folwark. It is a large farm worked by various serfs to produce surpluses for trade that is both internal and external. So long as we can keep this system functional and perhaps reform the laws surrounding it over time, the folwark system will continue to contribute great amounts to our trade routes and our stockpiles."
 rememberance_of_the_piasts: "Lasting Piast Influence"
 rememberance_of_the_piasts_desc: "The Piast Dynasty, in our own tradition, under Mieszko I founded the first Polish state via his conversion to Christianity in April of 966. His successors did well to craft a unique kingdom near the fringe of Central Europe, though the Piasts fell on hard times during multiple generations. Despite all of the revolts, devolutions of central power, and invasions from foreign powers like the Bohemians and the Mongols, the Polish state survived in some distinct form. It is their grit, their will, and their devotion to the survival of our culture and state that runs through the veins of every Pole today. Let us never forget their legacy."
 liberties_of_the_szlachta_on_display: "Entice Foreign Nobility"
 liberties_of_the_szlachta_on_display_desc: "Polish szlachta (our equivalent to a noble) have exercised considerable influence in Polish politics ever since the latter part of the Piast Dynasty's reign. After the reunification of Poland through Wladyslaw the Elbow-high and Casimir III in the 1300s, compromises with various noble families within Poland led to them being where they are now: a powerful force within not only the rural parts of our state but also the royal court itself. Such power and compromise is understandably making foreign nobility jealous to some degree; if they want to visit for a while to see how we do things, why not let them?"
 from_lancers_to_hussars: "Toward the Hussar"
 from_lancers_to_hussars_desc: "The days of light cavalry raiding enemy settlements and helping skirmish with our main armies are coming to an end, unfortunately. There are still roles for cavalry as the field of battle evolves ever more, but we must choose how exactly we want to shape our own cavalry ranks. Part of our military, however, is already leaning into the idea of a power of newly equipped heavier versions of the old light cavalry we used to employ. Such hussars, as they are starting to be known as, seem to be the perfect blend of armor and speed whilst also being able to deal serious damage to enemy ranks in full."
 a_military_worth_standing_with: "Stretching Every Resource"
 a_military_worth_standing_with_desc: "The Polish state of the Piast Dynasty did not stretch that far in terms of total land area meaning that a standing army for them was far less of a concern. We are very different in this new era, however, and we must think about trying to modernize our military routinely as the age of feudal levies falls ever more into the past. Having patrols on major roads, guarded walls around crucial centers, and a solid force of defenders for capital defense alone are just some of the basic needs that can be fulfilled if we work toward having a serious standing army of some kind, one that isn't so reliant on serfs."
 political_philosophy_encouraged: "Think, Debate, Write, Publish"
 political_philosophy_encouraged_desc: "The szlachta may be thorns in our side at times and gracious gifts from the heavens at others, but one thing that has resulted from their increased influence and autonomy within our state is that they are thinking of new political and military ideas routinely. Whether it is for their own good, for the good of a friend, or simply because they have money and power and want to use it somehow, these influential manuscripts and papers that our szlachta publish should be spread around our royalty at once!"
 the_music_flows_forth: "Cultural Guests, Welcome!"
 the_music_flows_forth_desc: "The courts of our szlachta and the royal court as well house the potential to bring in a variety of artisans of various trades from different parts of Europe. It is thanks to our efforts in both the political and cultural realm that we can attract famous artists, composers, philosophers, theologians, astronomers, and even capable commanders. In time, as we treat these guests with hospitality and engage in fanciful yet influential talks with them, we will spread the word of just how prestigious the courts of Poland truly are."

#Qing Ideas
 eight_banners_for_three_divisons: "Eight Banners for Three Divisions"
 eight_banners_for_three_divisons_desc: "There traditionally have been banners that functioned as armies for our people, yet as we have grown to encompass so many more people groups, the need for more banners that utilize more people groups is at hand. Creating eight more banners for the two other principle people groups of our realm, the Han and the Mongols, will allow us to field many more core regiments of soldiers that are not just regular recruits with basic training. These banners will form the elite core of the Qing Dynasty going forward and they will march forth gloriously into the fires of war wherever they may be."
 succeed_the_great_jin: "Succeed the Great Jin"
 succeed_the_great_jin_desc: "In the times of old, our ancestors carved out a grandiose state for themselves through the rebellion of Wanyan Aguda against the Liao Dyansty. After dismantling the Liao Dynasty, those of Great Jin pursued several wars against the Song Dynasty wherein they ultimately came to a stalemate yet they proved to all others just how strong the Jurchens of the north could be. We must emulate the strength and the unity that those of Great Jin achieved, for if we can do so, we will be able to stand up to any outside or inside threat."
 absorb_old_ming_scholars_and_academies: "Embrace the Old Literati"
 absorb_old_ming_scholars_and_academies_desc: "We must not tarnish and destroy all that the Ming Dynasty built up in terms of scientific and philosophic discovery. They have achieved many great things that are now foundational to our military, administration, trade sector, and even our naval vessels. Embracing such scholarly gentry (otherwise known as literati) into the folds of the Qing Dynasty will give us a solid foundation for future research endeavors in any sector we deem fit."
 establishing_the_green_standard: "The Green Standard Army"
 establishing_the_green_standard_desc: "Defectors from the crumbling Ming Dynasty and the outcasts of society, they are potential bandits and brigands amidst everyday folk doing business in the Qing Dynasty. Instead of cracking down on them with fines or imprisonment, we should recruit them into the military and give them an actual occupation they are paid for, even if it is being a guard for a small village. Brigands and bands of thieves will find their numbers shrinking whilst our military numbers steadily rise over time as we get these downtrodden folks equipped with basic weaponry, training, and a livable wage."
 calligraphy_and_painting_of_the_gentry: "Scholarly Gentry Flourishing"
 calligraphy_and_painting_of_the_gentry_desc: "Not only do the literati of the Qing Dynasty the past with the present in terms of scientific breakthroughs and philosophical thinking, they also strive to create new works of art that utilize both older styles and newer techniques. Such cultural flourishing is readily embraced within our administration and we only wish to promote it through the patronage of more calligraphers, painters, sculptors, and musicians."
 crack_down_on_corrupt_silver_economics: "Breathe Life into Anti-Corruption"
 crack_down_on_corrupt_silver_economics_desc: "More and more we are seeing that silver is being used instead of other currencies as the flow of silver within the markets across our neighbors and our own is increasing with every passing month. Our financiers and merchants are ready to accept the transition toward silver as a standard currency, but we must be ready to cut down excesses gained through corrupt means with this new currency since it is not minted into a regulated coin like the standard copper coins of the past. Once we have a strong handle on the trading of silver in our own markets, we will be able to work the global market in a far better way."
 provincial_bureaucracy_to_the_viceroy: "The Making of New Viceroys"
 provincial_bureaucracy_to_the_viceroy_desc: "Administration within our state, the Qing Dynasty, is just as orderly as the Ming Dynasty was. Indeed we have taken up where our old rivals left off in terms of how provinces and prefectures are governed, but the position of 'viceroy' or 'governor-general' of various regions is something that is a bit more novel. Promoting this position as our empire expands and sectioning our lands into distinct, recognizable provinces for the viceroys to govern will allow for a much more streamlined system to work with."

#Yuan ideas
 succeed_the_earth_stop_the_fire: "Succeed the Earth; Stop the Fire"
 succeed_the_earth_stop_the_fire_desc: "In the tradition of the Five Elements, we of the Yuan Dynasty take up the element of metal which is symbolized by the color white. Though some question our decision to go with metal due to the fact that they see the Song Dynasty as the actual dynasty that came before us, we know that the true precursor to us was the Jin Dynasty, the one that chose earth as its elemental symbol. Metal succeeds earth just as we are to succeed the Jurchen Jin Dynasty and as time goes on, we will work to stop what traditionally curtails metal in the tradition of the Five Elements: fire. Wherever that firey inferno may come from, we will snuff it out and have the world bow to the might of the white banners."
 to_tempt_the_empowered_military_nobles: "A Daring Gamble"
 to_tempt_the_empowered_military_nobles_desc: "In the times of Kublai Khan, Temur Khan, and the following successors, military nobles that were granted fiefs appanages with serfs saw themselves as empowered by the government itself. They were not curtailed in any major sense and thus grew to have a troubled relationship with future leaders of the dynasty. We are similar in how militarized our society is compared to our ancestors and also how divided into social classes our land can be, thus making us lean into trusting the military nobles like before for both internal control and external influence. These nobles can be the source of great tension in our future, yet we will learn from how our ancestors fell and succeed in this precarious sector."
 the_new_keshig_and_suwei_with_gunpowder: "Keshig and Suwei, Reformed"
 the_new_keshig_and_suwei_with_gunpowder_desc: "The old ways of the Keshig and Suwei are being forgotten amongst various military leaders within our state, yet the archives detail just how effective the old organization and tactics were if the proper soldiers and attention were around. Let us take those dusty old manuscripts and tomes and combine the knowledge they possess with the technology of today and work to combine the traditions of the Keshig and Suwei with gunpowder weapons. We can be even more fearsome than our ancestors if we adapt these deadly weapons into various formations, strategies, and organizational units."
 medicinal_knowledge_expanded_upon: "Medicinal Explorations"
 medicinal_knowledge_expanded_upon_desc: "Medicine is but a small part of scientific innovations, that much is true, but during the time of the Kublai Khan and his successors, medicine and its limits were explored thoroughly and some significant advances were made back then that we still use today. If we subsidize the work our current physicians do and allow them to explore new avenues of research with various herbs, spices, plants, and possibly even minerals if they deem it necessary, we could see breakthroughs that benefit not only the peasantry or clerical class, but also the royalty as well!"
 systematic_firearms_production: "Supply Chains for Firearms"
 systematic_firearms_production_desc: "In the midst of the older Yuan Dynasty, the production of firearms and gunpowder was systematic to some degree, but it was not as refined as it could be. The administration had a variety of other things to focus on and streamlining the production of military equipment was fairly low on the list of things to do. Now that we are back and better than ever, we should pick up where the Yuan Dynasty and the Ming Dynasty left off in the heart of the Middle Kingdom; going forward, we will become a grand center for the production of firearms and gunpowder!"
 compromise_of_the_state_but_still_different: "Know the Differences and Similarities"
 compromise_of_the_state_but_still_different_desc: "An empire like our own cannot run every single area and region as if they were like the capital of the empire, where laws are as strict and orderly as can be. In essence, we must compromise on several topics with various regional people groups which our ancestors did to a great degree too. Mixing elements of Chinese bureaucracy with military administration alongside clericl functions and perhaps even dividing things along ethnic or tribal lines when needed is going to mean we get the most out of our people no matter where they are. If our ancestors could do as such and still prosper, so to can we."
 yuan_bureaus_provinces_and_divisions: "The Bureaus and Divisions"
 yuan_bureaus_provinces_and_divisions_desc: "We may seem like a fairly sinicized dynasty to outsiders if they just look at our labels, but beneath the labels is a living and breathing legal framework and insitutional network that spans across vast stretchs of people and land. Taking key notes from the Yuan Dynasty of old like having the traditional triple division of authority (civil, military, and censorial), a Central Secretariat, a Privy Council, and even including a new and reformed Ministry of Justice, we are quickly approaching the administrative expertise with which our ancestors once governed. In time, we will even surpass them as our empire continues to grow in all avenues and we learn to both reshape and reform our administrative ranks."

 surrender_through_words_or_by_force: "Through Words or by Force"
 surrender_through_words_or_by_force_desc: "We know we will get our way, it just is a matter of time and for people to choose what path they go down. They may try to resist and put up a fight against our plethora of cavalry, but in the end it will be of no use when they see just how massive our military can be in conjunction with coordinated attacks, defenses, and overall movements across a wide variety of terrains. One way or another they will surrender their land and their prosperity to us."
 a_military_of_scaling_meritocracy: "Meritocratic Ranks"
 a_military_of_scaling_meritocracy_desc: "Much like how the start of the Mongol Empire had part of its origins in a meritocratic military structure, we too will emulate this across our entire military. Your ancestry means nothing in the ranks of the keshig or any other part of our military if you cannot back up said ancestry with skill and prowess. From the basics of knowing how to ride a horse and knowing basic self-defense to more advanced aspects like being able shoot accurately whilst riding at full gallop or knowing how to execute and orderly retreat, we will refine the quality of our infantry, cavalry, and artillery alike."
 kurultai_with_new_politics_in_play: "The New Kurultai"
 kurultai_with_new_politics_in_play_desc: "We have learned much sense the passing of our ancestral empire into history; it's rebirth, however, allows for reforms to take place all across the spectrum. One such place where we will implement reforms is the kurultai, the traditional meeting to decide who the next khan of the entire empire. Whilst previously it proved to be somewhat draining on our expansionist leadership due to being held in one singular place between all subordinate khans and such, we will work to have it be more flexible in location and time whilst also being more focused on the quality of the next in line to rule alongside the quality of the advisors."
 resistance_begets_nothing_but_tears_and_bones: "Resistance Begets Nothing"
 resistance_begets_nothing_but_tears_and_bones_desc: "Let it be known that when there is resistance to us in the form of uprisings or foreigners refusing to surrender and instead opting to fight us in a war of some kind, there will be nothing but bones, ashes, and the tears of the survivors left when we are done. In large part we are content with seeing the fields of those who oppose us go up in flames; the foolish defenders ruthlessly cut down; and captured sympathizers made out to be examples to others."
 ideas_of_math_and_astronomy_spread: "By Math; By Astronomy"
 ideas_of_math_and_astronomy_spread_desc: "The heavens have much in the way of knowledge, but so much of it is hidden from us! So many of us are concerned with expansion, plunder, diplomacy, taxation, trade, recruitment, and a plethora of other matters that are important in their own right, but we should never forget just how far the subjects of math and astronomy can go in benefiting the entire empire. More precise calculations for engineering, more accurate measurements for the stars above so we can better nail down equinoxes and such, both of these aspects and more are the results of funding mathematics and astronomy. Perhaps we might even glimpse into parts of our own future if enough research is funded!"
 feared_like_no_other: "Let them Hate, as long as they Fear"
 feared_like_no_other_desc: "People can hate us as long as they want; various dukes, rajas, shahs, emirs, barons, whoever they are, all of them can resent us if they so choose, we cannot control their thoughts. What we can control, though, is how much fear we exude and how intimidating we are to outsiders and those inside our borders. Our methods may be cruel to some, but knowing the true value of fear and using it to its greatest extent will be a guiding principle for us."

#Deccan Ideas
 the_beating_heart_of_the_subcontinent: "The Beating Heart"
 the_beating_heart_of_the_subcontinent_desc: "We of the Deccan are stationed in the heart of the entire subcontinent and we have inherited a plethora of good and bad things to deal with. It isn't enough to just observe the Deccan on the surface and barely investigate what goes on in the various towns and cities; we must instead be willing to get our hands a little dirty working with and learning about the various people that make up our state. Whether they are Muslims of Iranian descent, followers of Jainism that are minding their own business, or even Brahmins that are working on their own behalf, we must account for them in our spreadsheets and documents and hear them out on what concerns they have."
 the_marathas_situation: "Dealing with the Marathas"
 the_marathas_situation_desc: "Despite our best efforts to rectify local issues between religious and cultural communities throughout the Deccan, one persistent issue that is divided along cultural lines is that of the Marathas. They are not mere peasants blindly following our administration; they know their illustrious history and just how powerful they as a people group can be if they are unified enough. It is this brewing unrest in the more remote Marathas communities that we must put down through either diplomatic compromises or military authority. In dealing with these internal issues, we can and will learn about how our forces can do better defending and attacking within the confines of the Deccan as a whole."
 economics_of_hyderabad: "Economics of the Deccan"
 economics_of_hyderabad_desc: "The times of the past where agriculture and taxation formed the majority of the income for a state are slowly going away. More and more we are seeing foreign ships come to the shores of our glorious state to do business; they speak of places like Paris, London, Lisbon, Valencia, Tunis, and many other places wishing to have more of the various textiles we produce in large quantities with the utmost quality. In accordance with this growing trade sector of ours, we should be looking into how to maximize our profits from trade centers on our coast instead of relying solely on taxation for upwards of more than half of our revenue."
 know_how_foreigners_fight: "Studying Abroad"
 know_how_foreigners_fight_desc: "With these foreigners coming to our land for trade, they bring with them tales of their own land and how they do combat. Bloody wars in regions across Europe and Africa breed new tactics over time which our military has been particularly keen in studying for themselves. Maybe if we can set up an 'officer exchange' program of sorts with one or more European states, we can start to study how exactly they fight skirmishes and pitched battles."
 a_palace_with_jewels_fit_for_it: "Jewels from Hyderabad"
 a_palace_with_jewels_fit_for_it_desc: "The precious gems mined our of Hyderabad and other places throughout the Deccan are some of the finest the world has ever seen. Not only this, but our work to develop our capital and establish it as a place where a proper and illustrious ruler can exercise power from has been going very well so far. Hyderabad is one of the most developed cities in the entirety of the subcontinent at this point and as such it is ripe for making an impact of foreign diplomats and envoys that make visits to us."
 new_industries_rising_up_in_the_deccan: "Oversee New Industries"
 new_industries_rising_up_in_the_deccan_desc: "The rise of Hyderabad as a wealthy city that can project its power throughout so many parts of the Deccan and beyond means that other cities are following its lead. Places like Ujjain, Bidar, and Delhi are attempting to emulate the example of Hyderabad and are seeing the rise of various new industries that draw upon the expertise of many individuals and require new technologies to be sustained. We must not get in the way of this urban progression if we are to keep our place on the world stage; we should be encouraging these new industries as much as we can!"
 maintain_an_internal_focus: "Our Work is Never Done"
 maintain_an_internal_focus_desc: "We may think that someday the Deccan will be a stable, sustainable state that will have very little issues running on its own with little guidance from the royal family, but this notion is entirely untrue. A state is never 'finished' in any sense; the empires and states of the past, like the Gupta Empire or the Rashtrakuta Dynasty, are clear examples of this. Thus, if we are to continue to be successful as a state governing the beating heart of the subcontinent, we must never take our eyes off the internal matters that consistently shift around from day to day, week to week, and month to month. Answers to our problems lay not beyond our borders, but rather they lay inside, like a puzzle that is never quite solved."

#Roman Empire Ideas
 pretenders_put_to_rest: "Putting Foolish Ambitions to Rest"
 pretenders_put_to_rest_desc: "There have been pretenders to the legacy of the once great Roman Empire of the past, yet its fracturing and degradation due to a myriad of problems meant that others could try to usurp the once glorious title. Finally these pretenders are no more! Without a shadow of a doubt we have reclaimed the imperial legacy and brought the glory from the past to the present! All within and outside of Europe will know this to be true whether they like it or not!"
 reformation_of_roman_provinces: "Imperial and Senatorial Provinces"
 reformation_of_roman_provinces_desc: "The borders of past Roman provinces (both imperial and senatorial ones) were lacking in their administrative strategy as it disregarded geography and the people groups living in various places, meaning internal tensions in various provinces could easily break out and the bureaucracy would struggle to handle it. We can remake these provinces alongside actual geographic and cultural lines though since we have a much more in-depth understanding of the land than our ancestors did."
 adaptable_legions_reborn: "Imperial Legions"
 adaptable_legions_reborn_desc: "Is there anything more iconic about our ancestors than the legions themselves? Truly they were a marvel for their time, but they were vulnerable to corruption and lapses in training due to how big the old empire was in conjunction with how autonomous legions could be. If we are to bring back the notion of legions within our own military today, we must take steps to centralize the military as a whole whilst also ensuring that our soldiers and commanders are ready for whatever threat comes their way."
 monumental_architecture_of_true_romans: "Roman Architecture, Reborn"
 monumental_architecture_of_true_romans_desc: "The old architecture of the Roman Empire still stands to this day in a variety of places. Some of these structures have been repurposed for modern usage whilst others have been left to be reclaimed by nature itself, but the fact that there is so much still around is a testament to just how impactful our ancestors were with buildings alone. By using modern materials and logistics in conjunction with old Roman stylings, we can ensure our buildings are both glorious and functional in more ways than one."
 efficient_engineering: "Roman Engineering, Revitalized"
 efficient_engineering_desc: "Few would ever doubt the ingenious engineering that the Roman Empire conducted throughout its time before being fractured. From bridges to aqueducts to siege weapons and more, our ancestors were true masters of engineering for their time period and it is up to us to live up that legacy. Through the construction of new structures that are meant for both civilian and military use, we will refine our artisans and engineers over time so that they can serve both economic and militaristic purposes."
 citizens_of_new_roman_empire: "Redefine the Roman Citizen"
 citizens_of_new_roman_empire_desc: "Actual full-blooded Roman citizens in the old empire were few and far between when compared to the population of non-Roman people. This made it so that there was a clear separation between how non-citizens and citizens though there was a slow process of 'Romanization' through the prospect of becoming a citizen over time. If we can reform this process and bring it under a sense of control throughout the entire empire as it stands today, we will be able to bring in more people to contribute to the economy and the military."
 casus_belli: "Casus Belli"
 casus_belli_desc: "Where there is land in the hands of those hostile to Rome, there will always be a case for war. Though foreign envoys may try to downplay the fact that their ruler may refuses Roman customs, traders, diplomats, or demands from us, we know the truth of it all. There is no need to hear it outright; there will always be an enemy of Rome near and far which necessitates the occasion for war."

#Holy Roman Empire Ideas
 era_of_the_empire: "A Holy and Roman Era Begins"
 era_of_the_empire_desc: "It has been centuries since the Holy Roman Empire was established, yet it has seen so much contention for power between estates, religious factions, and even potential emperors. From the times of Otto I to Frederick I and beyond, there has been very little peace in Central Europe despite the Holy Roman Empire on paper being able to resolve such conflicts, but that time is now officially over. Now we look to a new era, an era where Central Europe has a uniform military, administration, and trade sector that cannot be matched by the French, the English, nor the Italians or Iberians. Truly there will be none that can match us going forward."
 roman_ranks_reformed: "Like the Romans in our Ranks"
 roman_ranks_reformed_desc: "The Roman Empire of old was almost unmatched in the area of disciplined army strength and logistical prowess, but the decline over the course of the 200s to 400s meant that discipline fell and supply lines were increasingly put under stress. If there is one thing a unified Holy Roman Empire can work on first in the area of militarism, it is the logistics sector as we have plenty of roads to compound upon and also a plethora of fighting men ready to be organized into a cohesive set of regiments."
 lessons_on_imperial_diplomacy: "Child of Diplomacy"
 lessons_on_imperial_diplomacy_desc: "In a sense, our unified state can be said to be a product of diplomacy between states within the Holy Roman Empire. From Austria to Saxony and from Hesse to Bohemia, diplomacy between various parts of Central Europe was always in play somehow and we as a unified state rightfully emulate that legacy, but this time to other parts of the world. Whether our diplomats go to other European courts or to the gilded halls of East Asia, or even strange courts down in Africa or the Americas, there will always be a sense of imperial prestige and grandeur that follows."
 one_final_administration_above_all: "United We Stand"
 one_final_administration_above_all_desc: "The unification of the Holy Roman Empire is a monumental achievement in it of itself. To ensure that such an administration can handle the various matters that states like Austria, Saxony, or Bohemia struggled with is no small feat; our court has grown to encompass a huge amount of officials that few other courts would be able to compare to. Yet it is because of our efficient court and our expedient officials that we are able to handle all these governing tasks and more. Truly the empire embodies both quality and quantity unlike any other state within Europe!"
 north_to_south_trade_routes: "From North to South in Peace"
 north_to_south_trade_routes_desc: "Thanks to there being a unified state within Central Europe that stretches from the north to the south completely, there is very little in the way of brigands or bandits roaming between borders; we can effectively guard the trade routes with our own troops. It is because of this safety and the fact that traders can travel with great ease now throughout Central Europe that we are seeing more and more investors come to our cities like Hamburg, Vienna, and Nuremburg to make deals."
 control_over_the_estates_and_classes: "Concentrated Central Control"
 control_over_the_estates_and_classes_desc: "Previously there had been Free Cities, Bishoprics, Prince-Bishoprics, an Arch-Duchy, and various other statelets that claimed small titles within the Holy Roman Empire; each one allowed a certain estate or two to gain immense power and thus cause power shifts across entire regions. Now that there is no such government that allows such petty statelets to claim such independent titles, we can effectively exert more control over the clergy, middle class, and nobility overall no matter where they are or who they descend from."
 unparalleled_court_grandeur: "Like No Other"
 unparalleled_court_grandeur_desc: "Whilst Paris, London, Rome, and Constantinople may be able to attract astute and bright minds in their own right, it is only the Holy Roman Empire that can truly bring them all together in a grand capacity. Advisors speaking a wide variety of languages and hailing from different parts of our own empire and from across the world gather within our courts to present what they have to offer, knowing that we hold the legacy of so many powerful and prestigious states from before like Austria and Bohemia."

#Navarra Ideas
 divided_have_we_been: "Divided Without End"
 divided_have_we_been_desc: "Since the inception of a possibly independent state for Basque people, this land has been divided up between rival powers. Whether they were Muslims or Catholics, French of Castilian, or any other sort of contender for power in the region, they were routinely in contest for our land at some point. Let us make good on these attempts and try to play them off of each other when we can; perhaps forging dynastic alliances once more could net us a stronger base of power."
 memories_of_king_charles_ii: "Remember King Charles II"
 memories_of_king_charles_ii_desc: "Charles the Bad, reigning from 1349 to 1387 as King of Navarra, was a pivotal figure not only for Navarra but also for the English and the French in the Hundred Years' War. He switched sides at multiple points and attempted to further his own ambitions by playing to one side or the other in the war, though his ambitions were left unfulfilled in the end. It would be good for us to embody the more diplomatic side of Charles II's reign instead of his more cruel side since we could certainly use more connections and agents in foreign cities to inform us who we should fight for."
 lessons_of_the_navarrese_company: "The Old Navarrese Company"
 lessons_of_the_navarrese_company_desc: "The memories of the Navarrese Company are still recent in the minds of several nobles within our land. Formed initially under Charles II to go against Charles V of France, they were eventually organized to go eastward in the 1370s after the earnest recruiting efforts of Enguerrand VII of Coucy. With lances, mounted archers, and engineers at the ready, they performed very well as a mercenary company in the lands of the crumbling Byzantine Empire up until the 1380s. Their legacy rings through the streets of Navarra still to this very day in the mercenary contracts we take up and in the engineers we hire for both military and civilian uses."
 the_war_of_the_bands: "The War of the Bands"
 the_war_of_the_bands_desc: "troublesome are the nobility... So much so that they've been feuding throughout the late 1300s and into the early 1400s! Royal authority barely had an impact on them as repeatedly the nobles sought to sort their differences out through their own individual means; it wasn't until exterior powers came through to enforce some sort of law and order that they quieted down. Though some would see this as an excuse to crack down on them, we know that we can use these nobles and their entrenched identities to our advantage should we be on good terms with them. They can be very valuable informants for our administration should foreign powers be trying to make moves against us."
 re_establish_royal_authority: "Bring Back Royal Authority"
 re_establish_royal_authority_desc: "Though the War of the Bands is well and truly over, royal authority is still lacking in some of the more rural parts of our state due to the fact that the previously autonomous nobility were able to build their own quarters away from the peering eyes of our administration. We shoudl work to enlist more loyal officials and steadily expand our court in size in accordance with our expanding economy so that we can keep better track of these more rural areas; royal authority cannot and will not be evaded."
 entrenched_nobility_of_navarra: "The Entrenched Nobility"
 entrenched_nobility_of_navarra_desc: "And whilst we try to exercise control over the noble families of Navarra even more, we will not tear down the fortified settlements they've built up. Such works of stone and wood are useful in defending the land from foreign invaders or even stopping internal revolts from spreading. In time we might even start to emulate how our nobles have built up their strongholds so that we can have a more concrete defensive system."
 crossing_of_dynasties: "Footprints of Many Dynasties"
 crossing_of_dynasties_desc: "Despite us being a place where foreign dynasties sought to implant themselves to further the interests of the crowns of France, Castile, or Aragon, we have prospered somewhat by this influx of foreign influences and trade throughout Basque communities. Welcoming more foreign dynasties into our court and perhaps even marrying into some of them would keep Navarra's reputation afloat in this regard, and it would aid us in getting more powerful allies across Europe."

#East Frisia & Friesland Ideas
 frisian_ideas: "Frisian Ideas"
 frisian_ideas_start: "Frisian Traditions"
 frisian_ideas_bonus: "Frisian Ambition"
 fight_for_frisian_freedom: "Frisian Freedom!"
 fight_for_frisian_freedom_desc: "Unlike much of the rest of Europe, these marshy and swampy lands of ours are hard to govern since communities are far more spread out and we do not have large urban centers akin to Vienna, Paris, or Rome. This has led to a concept of 'Frisian Freedom' wherein governance is fairly decentralized and horizontal in its governing structure; there have been few if any families of great power akin to the nobles of the rest of Europe. We have not been able to stave off the advancing tide of feudalism forever, however, and it consistently encroaches on Frisian lands like the tide of the sea, but it is not unstoppable! We must never forget what freedom our ancestors had and we must always be ready to fight for it!"
 schieringers_versus_vetkopers: "Schieringers vs. Vetkopers"
 schieringers_versus_vetkopers_desc: "Factional politics arose throughout Frisia despite our history of Frisian Freedom. The Vetkopers and Schieringers are the prime suspects here and have stoked the flames of ongoing internal feuds and outright civil wars across the lands of Frisia (both in Friesland and East Frisia). Outside forces have sought to take advantage of the factionalism by allying with one faction or the other, yet this has proven to be unsuccessful time and time again as the other faction comes back in time when they are given the opportunity. No matter which side we end up going with, we can at the very least be sure we will ample leadership ready to serve our administration."
 continue_the_elections_of_the_potestaat: "The Position of Potestaat"
 continue_the_elections_of_the_potestaat_desc: "Freemen of Frisia have been able to elect local potestaats to serve as their elected representative, though rarely did any single potestaat have enough power to try to exert their control the entirety of Frisian lands. There has been one potestaat elected to lead Friesland (Juw Juwinga in 1396 by the Schieringers), but this did not stop the process of local potestaats from being elected afterwards, thus carrying forth the notion of a very horizontal governing structure. If we are to survive as an independent polity that respects its own people and traditions, we would do well to uphold the notion of potestaats for our state."
 let_them_fall_like_arnulf_of_holland: "Let them Fall like Arnulf!"
 let_them_fall_like_arnulf_of_holland_desc: "The foolishness of Arnulf, Count of Holland still rings as a clear example of the power of Frisian people and their will to maintain autonomy and independence. Despite Arnulf's attempt to proclaim himself as count of Oostergo and Westergo, the Frisians he did battle with resisted courageously and killed him in battle. With his death, Frisian Freedom can be said to have been secured for the first time. Truly it was a pivotal point in our history, one that gives our civilians and soldiers the vigor to resist any foreign army that attempts to subjugate us."
 supported_by_monasters_and_the_wealthy_alike: "Both Big and Small Contributions"
 supported_by_monasters_and_the_wealthy_alike_desc: "No matter the conflict that came through to the borders of Frisian communities, people donated their time, money, and materials to the cause they thought was most viable. Monasteries and wealthy families alike did what they could in supporting either the Schieringers, the Vetkopers, or even some third or fourth parties when the conflict was large enough. Once we have a solid grasp on who will bein our administration and how we will direct the legislative processes, we will be able to utilize these sources of revenue and popular support for our own purposes. We just need to be sure they don't turn things into a factional mess."
 more_than_just_trade_wars: "Multi-Sided Wars"
 more_than_just_trade_wars_desc: "As trade routes have grown throughout the 1400s, the notion of hindering enemy trade ships and merchants on the high seas has become increasingly common. In our wars against Holland, Utrecht, and other polities of the Lowlands, all of the various political parties and factions have begun to embark on these daring expeditions to disrupt enemy trade so that they can bleed the economy of the other side out. Perhaps Frisian sailors and traders can do similarly?"
 the_black_hope_of_arum: "Hope during the Blackest of Days"
 the_black_hope_of_arum_desc: "Even when the enemy has breached the walls of various Frisian towns and cities, our people do not rest easily and submit themselves to the domination of foreign invaders. Time and time again the wealthy families and individuals of our various communities have taken up arms to resist the enemy and they have even funded the arming of peasantry so that they can take part. Let this be a lesson, then, to any hostile state that would see Frisian lands annexed: there will be no rest and no peace in any community of ours that you unlawfully seize!"

 separate_military_and_administrative_sectors: "Separated Sectors"
 separate_military_and_administrative_sectors_desc: "The Dalai Lama can handle the religious and administration of the land; we will stick to what we know best: military matters. If we can keep this healthy relationship going and our borders relatively safe, our future conquests will become much easier to integrate into our up-and-coming state."
 dissent_is_paid_for_in_blood: "To Dissent is to Die"
 dissent_is_paid_for_in_blood_desc: "We will not stand by and let those who riot and revolt take pieces of our land away from us or take valuable bits of our time up because they feel that things should be different. If they wish to dissent against our actions or the actions of the Dalai Lama, then let them break their will against our military might! There is no room for mercy for rebellious peasants or nobles in the lands of the Khoshuud!"
 to_convert_or_to_die: "One True Way of Buddhism"
 to_convert_or_to_die_desc: "Prior to us coming into the lands of Tibet to take over things, the religious landscape was full of various Tibetan Buddhist schools fighting against each other both politically and religiously to gain ultimate authority over the region. Now that we are in charge though, we can enforce the one actual true school of Tibetan Buddhism and start to root out the others from the land. They will either submit to the Dalai Lama, go into exile, or bathe in their own bloody graves."
 providing_for_ourselves_in_tibet: "Becoming Self Sustaining"
 providing_for_ourselves_in_tibet_desc: "This land isn't fertile like regions surrounding it; places like Sichuan, the Bengal Delta, and the Ganges River all host a plethora of fertile land that we would absolutely love to have, but they are not in reach just yet. Thus, we need to become more self reliant through building our own production of weapons and supplies. In conjunction with the efforts of the Dalai Lama, we can make an effective internal production chain that will keep Khoshuud ranks filled."
 zealotry_in_our_ranks: "Zealots One and All"
 zealotry_in_our_ranks_desc: "There are several states around us that refuse to follow the one true faith that holds the Dalai Lama as its head and us as its enforcers. As such, it is our duty to spread the true faith to them through either diplomacy or force, but more often than not it is going to have to be the latter. Our experience at the very start of our existence has been that of religioust strife and civil unrest due to religious differences; such experiences help stoke the fires of zealotry that burn within all Khoshuud armies."
 natural_defensiveness_of_tibet: "In Defense of the Faith"
 natural_defensiveness_of_tibet_desc: "And when our defenses like our faith are tested by ruthless invaders, we will stand tall behind the stiff mountain walls of Tibet. We need not emphasize a defensive position with several castles and fortresses like surrounding states when we have several areas where armies suffer greatly just because of nature alone; let us use these areas to our advantage when our heartland is under threat."
 break_the_balance_of_religions: "Breaking the Balance"
 break_the_balance_of_religions_desc: "For far too long there has been a sort of balance of religious schools in Tibetan lands yet the balance has shifted around from time to time, favoring one school or another depending on how things played out. With our presence throughout all of Tibet however, we are able to fully break down this balance and start to uphold one school above all others. It is through our efforts in this regard that we will gather more faithful followers and also more capable advisors with the right religious mindset."
